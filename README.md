# DS_fake_news
This is the repository for the Fake News classifier Project, part of the Data Science course at University of Copehagen in 2023, conducted by group 57.
The different scripts have been seperated into their relevant directories.


# necesary dependencies
The repository should include all code that is needed to reproduce the results from the project. Due to size constraints, there are several large files,
which are not included in the repository. This will often result in a file-not-found error when running the different notebooks.

Therefore we provide links to download several large files that where used during the project:

- Vocab.pkl: a pickled list of tuples each with a word and its frequency in the fake news corpus
  - https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/gLpZPm84dp
- fake_news_cleaned.csv: similar to the orginal corpus, but where corrupted rows have been removed
  - https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/CwrLUB0wA4
- fake_news_cleaned_filtered.csv: similar to the previous file on the list, but the data preproccesing has been applied to it.
