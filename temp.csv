We are NOT calling for the overthrow of the government. In fact, we are calling for the reinstatement of our government.

We are not calling for lawlessness. We are calling for an end to lawlessness and lack of accountability and a return to the rule of law.

Rather than trying to subvert the constitution, we are calling for its enforcement.

We are patriotic Americans born and raised in this country. We love the U.S. We don't seek to destroy or attack America ... we seek to restore her to strength, prosperity, liberty and respect.

We don't support or like Al Qaeda, ISIS, the Taliban, or any similar or supporting groups. We think they are all disgusting.

The nation's top legal scholars say that draconian security laws which violate the Constitution should not apply to Americans.

The Wall Street Journal notes:

A U.S. attack on Syria would likely dash expectations of progress in nuclear negotiations with Iran and undermine new Iranian President Hasan Rouhani’s call for improving relations with the West, diplomats said. An attack on Damascus would likely give Iranian hard-liners, who oppose a nuclear compromise, the upper hand over moderate President Hasan Rouhani, who has made foreign policy and nuclear talks a priority. *** “A direct U.S.-Iran conflict in Syria will only widen the chasm of mistrust needed to be bridged in order to reach a nuclear accommodation,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Salon agrees:

Obama would be bombing Iran’s main ally, strengthening the hand of hardliners in Tehran and undermining Rouhani’s room for maneuver. *** Officials cautious of intervening say targeted strikes to punish Mr. Assad for using chemical weapons risk triggering a bloody escalation. If the regime digs in and uses chemical weapons again, or launches retaliatory attacks against the U.S. and its allies in the region, Mr. Obama will come under fierce pressure to respond more forcefully, increasing the chances of full-scale war, the officials say.

And, of course, Russia—which has declared that it won’t support an American action against Syria—could up the ante, too, by backing Assad more powerfully in response.



As we’ve previously noted, attacking Iran would only speed up its development of nuclear weapons, empower its hardliners, and undermine the chance for democratic reform. The same is true for Syria and any chemical weapons which the nation possesses.

Indeed, the key architect of America’s war plan against Syria says:

If we start picking off chemical weapons targets in Syria, the logical response is if any weapons are left in the warehouses, he’s going to start dispersing them among his forces ….

If they’re dispersed away from central government warehouses to scattered military forces, they are more likely to be used.

Finally, bombing the Syrian government will strengthen the Al Qaeda, Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood dominated rebels.

“Prayers don’t work. We need legislation,”is the mantra of the “secular progressives” we are told by Lutheran minister Hans Fiene, who just published a column in a religious blog with the headline “When The Saints Of First Baptist Church Were Murdered, God Was Answering Their Prayers.” His response is proof of the tragic division in this country between people who are calling for sane gun legislation and people who are spinning these tragedies out as having different meanings, including Donald Trump who characterized the latest mass murder as “a mental health issue” “it isn’t a guns situation.” 26 people killed by one gun, how could it possibly be a gun situation? First, people react on twitter:

x The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers did anything, they'd still be alive, you worthless sack of shit. https://t.co/iGHxPrYrLN — Wil Wheaton (@wilw) November 5, 2017

x Paul Ryan is the Speaker of the House. He can offer laws and regulations to end this, but he offers thoughts and prayers instead. — Wil Wheaton (@wilw) November 5, 2017

Safety protocols *gun safes *locks, *safety certifications can lower premiums. Responsible gun owners will support! WRITE THE BILL! — InkResist (@InkResist) November 5, 2017

Now, the “God’s in his heaven and all’s right with the world,” drivel share for the day from the fine Rev. Fiene:

For those with little understanding of and less regard for the Christian faith, there may be no greater image of prayer’s futility than Christians being gunned down mid-supplication. But for those familiar with the Bible’s promises concerning prayer and violence, nothing could be further from the truth. When those saints of First Baptist Church were murdered yesterday, God wasn’t ignoring their prayers. He was answering them. “Deliver us from evil.” Millions of Christians throughout the world pray these words every Sunday morning. While it doesn’t appear that the Lord’s Prayer is formally a part of the worship services at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, I have no doubt that members of that congregation have prayed these words countless times in their lives. [...] So when a madman with a rifle sought to persecute the faithful at First Baptist Church on Sunday morning, he failed. Just like those who put Christ to death, and just like those who have brought violence to believers in every generation, this man only succeeded in being the means through which God delivered his children from this evil world into an eternity of righteousness and peace.

Wow. Well, from Rev. Fiene’s point of view, then I guess that if and when we pray we should be praying for yet more of these massacres so that we can all be delivered from this evil world forthwith. Maybe the shooter and all shooters should be canonized as saints, ya think, since they are our means of deliverance? Apparently this tragedy is not a tragedy at all, it’s a feel good story.

So the enemies of the gospel can pour out their murderous rage upon Christians, but all they can truly accomplish is placing us into the arms of our savior. [...] But we believers see the shooting in Texas as proof of something far different—proof that Christ has counted us worthy to suffer dishonor for his name and proof that no amount of dishonor, persecution, or violence can stop him from answering our prayer to deliver us from evil.

Maybe Donald Trump will nuke the planet and then we’ll all be delivered from evil, the plants and the animals, too, with one big bang and some mushroom clouds, raining down toxic hell from the sky. Remember, the so called Conservative Christians are the folks who would bring you the Rapture and the Apocalypse.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"Minister Spins Texas Tragedy Into Martyrdom Message, 'God Was Answering Their Prayers'","Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

Giant bank holding companies now own airports, toll roads, and ports; control power plants; and store and hoard vast quantities of commodities of all sorts. They are systematically buying up or gaining control of the essential lifelines of the economy. How have they pulled this off, and where have they gotten the money?

In a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke dated June 27, 2013, US Representative Alan Grayson and three co-signers expressed concern about the expansion of large banks into what have traditionally been non-financial commercial spheres. Specifically:

[W]e are concerned about how large banks have recently expanded their businesses into such fields as electric power production, oil refining and distribution, owning and operating of public assets such as ports and airports, and even uranium mining.

After listing some disturbing examples, they observed:

According to legal scholar Saule Omarova, over the past five years, there has been a “quiet transformation of U.S. financial holding companies.” These financial services companies have become global merchants that seek to extract rent from any commercial or financial business activity within their reach. They have used legal authority in Graham-Leach-Bliley to subvert the “foundational principle of separation of banking from commerce”. . . . It seems like there is a significant macro-economic risk in having a massive entity like, say JP Morgan, both issuing credit cards and mortgages, managing municipal bond offerings, selling gasoline and electric power, running large oil tankers, trading derivatives, and owning and operating airports, in multiple countries.



A “macro” risk indeed – not just to our economy but to our democracy and our individual and national sovereignty. Giant banks are buying up our country’s infrastructure – the power and supply chains that are vital to the economy. Aren’t there rules against that? And where are the banks getting the money?

How Banks Launder Money Through the Repo Market

In an illuminating series of articles on Seeking Alpha titled “Repoed!”, Colin Lokey argues that the investment arms of large Wall Street banks are using their “excess” deposits – the excess of deposits over loans – as collateral for borrowing in the repo market. Repos, or “repurchase agreements,” are used to raise short-term capital. Securities are sold to investors overnight and repurchased the next day, usually day after day.

The deposit-to-loan gap for all US banks is now about $$2 trillion, and nearly half of this gap is in Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo alone. It seems that the largest banks are using the majority of their deposits (along with the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing dollars) not to back loans to individuals and businesses but to borrow for their own trading. Acquiring a company or a portion of a company mostly with borrowed money is called a “leveraged buyout.” The banks are leveraging our money to buy up ports, airports, toll roads, power, and massive stores of commodities.

Using these excess deposits directly for their own speculative trading would be blatantly illegal, but the banks have been able to avoid the appearance of impropriety by borrowing from the repo market. (See my earlier article here.) The banks’ excess deposits are first used to purchase Treasury bonds, agency securities, and other highly liquid, “safe” securities. These liquid assets are then pledged as collateral in repo transactions, allowing the banks to get “clean” cash to invest as they please. They can channel this laundered money into risky assets such as derivatives, corporate bonds, and equities (stock).

That means they can buy up companies. Lokey writes, “It is common knowledge that prop [proprietary] trading desks at banks can and do invest in a variety of assets, including stocks.” Prop trading desks invest for the banks’ own accounts. This was something that depository banks were forbidden to do by the New Deal-era Glass-Steagall Act but that was allowed in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed those portions of Glass-Steagall.

The result has been a massively risky $$700-plus trillion speculative derivatives bubble. Lokey quotes from an article by Bill Frezza in the January 2013 Huffington Post titled “Too-Big-To-Fail Banks Gamble With Bernanke Bucks“:

If you think [the cash cushion from excess deposits] makes the banks less vulnerable to shock, think again. Much of this balance sheet cash has been hypothecated in the repo market, laundered through the off-the-books shadow banking system. This allows the proprietary trading desks at these “banks” to use that cash as collateral to take out loans to gamble with. In a process called hyper-hypothecation this pledged collateral gets pyramided, creating a ticking time bomb ready to go kablooey when the next panic comes around.

That Explains the Mountain of Excess Reserves

Historically, banks have attempted to maintain a loan-to-deposit ratio of close to 100%, meaning they were “fully loaned up” and making money on their deposits. Today, however, that ratio is only 72% on average; and for the big derivative banks, it is lower yet. The unlent portion represents the “excess deposits” available to be tapped as collateral for the repo market.

The Fed’s quantitative easing contributes to this collateral pool by converting less-liquid mortgage-backed securities into cash in the banks’ reserve accounts. This cash is not something the banks can spend for their own proprietary trading, but they can invest it in “safe” securities – Treasuries and similar securities that are also the sort of collateral acceptable in the repo market. Using this repo collateral, the banks can then acquire the laundered cash with which they can invest or speculate for their own accounts.

Lokey notes that US Treasuries are now being bought by banks in record quantities. These bonds stay on the banks’ books for Fed supervision purposes, even as they are being pledged to other parties to get cash via repo. The fact that such pledging is going on can be determined from the banks’ balance sheets, but it takes some detective work. Explaining the intricacies of this process, the evidence that it is being done, and how it is hidden in plain sight takes Lokey three articles, to which the reader is referred. Suffice it to say here that he makes a compelling case.

Can They Do That?

Countering the argument that “banks can’t really do anything with their excess reserves” and that “there is no evidence that they are being rehypothecated,” Lokey points to data coming to light in conjunction with JPMorgan’s $$6 billion “London Whale” fiasco. He calls it “clear-cut proof that banks trade stocks (and virtually everything else) with excess deposits.” JPM’s London-based Chief Investment Office [CIO] reported:

JPMorgan’s businesses take in more in deposits that they make in loans and, as a result, the Firm has excess cash that must be invested to meet future liquidity needs and provide a reasonable return. The primary reponsibility of CIO, working with JPMorgan’s Treasury, is to manage this excess cash. CIO invests the bulk of JPMorgan’s excess cash in high credit quality, fixed income securities, such as municipal bonds, whole loans, and asset-backed securities, mortgage backed securities, corporate securities, sovereign securities, and collateralized loan obligations.

Lokey comments:

That passage is unequivocal — it is as unambiguous as it could possibly be. JPMorgan invests excess deposits in a variety of assets for its own account and as the above clearly indicates, there isn’t much they won’t invest those deposits in. Sure, the first things mentioned are “high quality fixed income securities,” but by the end of the list, deposits are being invested in corporate securities [stock] and CLOs [collateralized loan obligations]. . . . [T]he idea that deposits are invested only in Treasury bonds, agencies, or derivatives related to such “risk free” securities is patently false.

He adds:

[I]t is no coincidence that stocks have rallied as the Fed has pumped money into the coffers of the primary dealers while ICI data shows retail investors have pulled nearly a half trillion from U.S. equity funds over the same period. It is the banks that are propping stocks.

Another Argument for Public Banking

All this helps explain why the largest Wall Street banks have radically scaled back their lending to the local economy. It appears that their loan-to-deposit ratios are low not because they cannot find creditworthy borrowers but because they can profit more from buying airports and commodities through their prop trading desks than from making loans to small local businesses.

Small and medium-sized businesses are responsible for creating most of the jobs in the economy, and they are struggling today to get the credit they need to operate. That is one of many reasons that we the people need to own some banks ourselves. Publicly-owned banks can direct credit where it is needed in the local economy; can protect public funds from confiscation through “bail-ins” resulting from bad gambling in by big derivative banks; and can augment public coffers with banking revenues, allowing local governments to cut taxes, add services, and salvage public assets from fire-sale privatization. Publicly-owned banks have a long and successful history, and recent studies have found them to be the safest in the world.

As Representative Grayson and co-signers observed in their letter to Chairman Bernanke, the banking system is now dominated by “global merchants that seek to extract rent from any commercial or financial business activity within their reach.” They represent a return to a feudal landlord economy of unearned profits from rent-seeking. We need a banking system that focuses not on casino profiteering or feudal rent-seeking but on promoting economic and social well-being; and that is the mandate of the public banking sector globally.

Exelon nuclear power company – the largest nuclear operator in the U.S. – issued a press release today stating:

Operators at Byron Generating Station [around 110 miles from Chicago] declared an Unusual Event at 10:18 a.m.CT, due to the loss of offsite power and Unit 2 coming offline. The nuclear facility’s diesel generators activated as designed to provide power to the facility when there is a loss of offsite power to the facility. The facility remains in a safe condition. Station engineering experts are looking into the cause of the loss of offsite power. Byron Station is designed to depressurize to reduce steam pressure as part of the many redundant safety systems built into the facility. Steam from the unit is released through safety relief valves that are specifically designed for this purpose. The steam, which will evaporate quickly, contained expected levels of tritium. Local residents may see or hear the steam release in progress, which will continue throughout the day until the unit cools down. These types of station releases are regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. There is no health or safety impact to workers or to the public from the release, and Exelon Nuclear has notified all appropriate local, state and federal officials of the Unusual Event.

*** Tritium is produced in greater concentrations in commercial nuclear reactors and is routinely discharged into the environment under strictregulatory guidelines.



Indeed, an AP investigation found that 75 percent of American nuclear plants leak tritium. And many plants leak tritium into local water supplies above maximum allowable levels for drinking water. (Nuclear plants are making up bogus excuses for refusing to test for tritium.)

While nuclear apologists pretend that “small” releases – like at Three Mile Island – cause no health effects, this is contrary to scientific evidence. See this and this.

And there have been so many accidents recently, that it makes one wonder whether we have the maturity to operate such inherently dangerous systems. See this, this, this and this.

Even When Operating Normally, Nuclear Plants Vent Radioactive Materials Which Cause Cancer

It’s not just tritium … and it’s not just accidents.

While the nuclear industry and its lapdogs in the nuclear agencies say that living near a nuclear plant is safe, numerous scientific studies have found that – even when operating “normally” – the plants cause cancer.

For example, numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies from around the world show that the incidence of leukemia is much higher for people living near nuclear plants. See this, this, this, this, this, this and this.

The bottom line is that nuclear power can be safe – or it can be cheap … but it can’t be both.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Illinois Nuclear Power Plant Loses Power ...

You know that the NSA and other government agencies are spying on all Americans.

But is the government just passively spying on us like some giant peeping Tom? Or doing something with that information?

Favoring “Friends”

U.S. intelligence agencies have given information gained through spying to a handful of giant corporations for many years. This trend is accelerating.

Harassing “Enemies”

While the NSA is the best-known spy agency at the moment, the IRS, FBI, and many other agencies also conduct their own mass spying on Americans.

Reuters recently broke the story that information gained through spying on Americans is funneled through a special unit within the Drug Enforcement Agency, and then distributed to federal, state and local agencies nationwide.

The agencies are instructed to “launder” the information by pretending that they got it from normal gumshoe investigations, and not spying.

Reuters notes that laundered information gained through spying is being used to prosecute petty crimes, including taxes and drugs … and neither the defense attorneys or even the judges are being told the real source of the information

Top NSA whistleblower William Binney – the former head of the National Security Agency’s global digital data gathering program, and a 32-year veteran of that agency who was a “legend” among NSA workers – says that the NSA database is used to harass and even frame anyone the government doesn’t like.

Another high-level NSA whistleblower (Russell Tice, who worked on satellite spying for the agency for two decades) says that the NSA is spying on – and blackmailing – top government officials and military officers (and see this; and this PBS interview).

Indeed, because government spying has always focused on crushing dissent, it is safe to assume that the government will use the information it gathers.

Propaganda

We’ve long reported that the government censors and manipulates social media. More proof here and here.

The Guardian reported in 2011:

The US military is developing software that will let it secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda. A Californian corporation has been awarded a contract with United States Central Command (Centcom), which oversees US armed operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, to develop what is described as an “online persona management service” that will allow one US serviceman or woman to control up to 10 separate identities based all over the world. *** The Centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background, history and supporting details, and that up to 50 US-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations “without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries”. *** Once developed, the software could allow US service personnel, working around the clock in one location, to respond to emerging online conversations with any number of co-ordinated messages, blogposts, chatroom posts and other interventions. Details of the contract suggest this location would be MacDill air force base near Tampa, Florida, home of US Special Operations Command. Centcom’s contract requires for each controller the provision of one “virtual private server” located in the United States and others appearing to be outside the US to give the impression the fake personas are real people located in different parts of the world. It also calls for “traffic mixing”, blending the persona controllers’ internet usage with the usage of people outside Centcom in a manner that must offer “excellent cover and powerful deniability”. *** Centcom confirmed that the $$2.76m contract was awarded to Ntrepid, a newly formed corporation registered in Los Angeles. It would not disclose whether the multiple persona project is already in operation or discuss any related contracts.

The army told the Guardian that it was not targeting Americans:

Centcom spokesman Commander Bill Speaks said: “The technology supports classified blogging activities on foreign-language websites to enable Centcom to counter violent extremist and enemy propaganda outside the US.” He said none of the interventions would be in English, as it would be unlawful to “address US audiences” with such technology, and any English-language use of social media by Centcom was always clearly attributed. The languages in which the interventions are conducted include Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Pashto. Centcom said it was not targeting any US-based web sites, in English or any other language, and specifically said it was not targeting Facebook or Twitter.

(Of course, the government has also repeatedly said it’s not spying on Americans … but we know that’s untrue.)

But things have changed dramatically since the Guardian article was written in 2011.

Michael Hastings – the reporter who mysteriously died in a fiery car crash – wrote last year:

An amendment that would legalize the use of propaganda on American audiences is being inserted into the latest defense authorization bill, BuzzFeed has learned. The amendment would “strike the current ban on domestic dissemination” of propaganda material produced by the State Department and the independent Broadcasting Board of Governors, according to the summary of the law at the House Rules Committee’s official website. The tweak to the bill would essentially neutralize two previous acts—the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act in 1987—that had been passed to protect U.S. audiences from our own government’s misinformation campaigns. The bi-partisan amendment is sponsored by Rep. Mac Thornberry from Texas and Rep. Adam Smith from Washington State. *** Thornberry warned that in the Internet age, the current law “ties the hands of America’s diplomatic officials, military, and others by inhibiting our ability to effectively communicate in a credible way.” The bill’s supporters say the informational material used overseas to influence foreign audiences is too good to not use at home, and that new techniques are needed to help fight Al-Qaeda, a borderless enemy whose own propaganda reaches Americans online. *** “I just don’t want to see something this significant – whatever the pros and cons – go through without anyone noticing,” *** The new law would give sweeping powers to the government to push television, radio, newspaper, and social media onto the U.S. public. “It removes the protection for Americans,” says a Pentagon official who is concerned about the law. “It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information. There are no checks and balances. No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false.” According to this official, “senior public affairs” officers within the Department of Defense want to “get rid” of Smith-Mundt and other restrictions because it prevents information activities designed to prop up unpopular policies—like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. *** The Pentagon spends some $$4 billion a year to sway public opinion already …. *** The evaporation of Smith-Mundt and other provisions to safeguard U.S. citizens against government propaganda campaigns is part of a larger trend within the diplomatic and military establishment. In December, the Pentagon used software to monitor the Twitter debate over Bradley Manning’s pre-trial hearing [the Federal Reserve is monitoring the web for criticism as well]; another program being developed by the Pentagon would design software to create “sock puppets” on social media outlets; and, last year, General William Caldwell, deployed an information operations team under his command that had been trained in psychological operations to influence visiting American politicians to Kabul. A U.S. Army whistleblower, Lieutenant Col. Daniel Davis, noted recently in his scathing 84-page unclassified report on Afghanistan that there remains a strong desire within the defense establishment “to enable Public Affairs officers to influence American public opinion when they deem it necessary to “protect a key friendly center of gravity, to wit US national will,” he wrote, quoting a well-regarded general.

Foreign Policy reported last month that the bill passed … and propaganda within the U.S. is now legal:

But if anyone needed a reminder of the dangers of domestic propaganda efforts, the past 12 months provided ample reasons. Last year, two USA Today journalists were ensnared in a propaganda campaign after reporting about millions of dollars in back taxes owed by the Pentagon’s top propaganda contractor in Afghanistan. Eventually, one of the co-owners of the firm confessed to creating phony websites and Twitter accounts to smear the journalists anonymously. [Background.]

Additionally, just this month, The Washington Post exposed a counter propaganda program by the Pentagon that recommended posting comments on a U.S. website run by a Somali expat with readers opposing Al-Shabaab. “Today, the military is more focused on manipulating news and commentary on the Internet, especially social media, by posting material and images without necessarily claiming ownership,” reported The Post.

So if it seems like there are disruptors everywhere on the Internet defending the “official” view … you might not be imagining it.

Non-mainstream liberal and conservative websites have both been complaining for years that trolls are defending mainstream government policies.

Cyber-Warfare

A high-level intelligence source said, “we hack everyone everywhere”.

While Edward Snowden’s revelations so far have focused on hacking foreign countries, it is worth asking whether the government is hacking political dissenters in the U.S. For example, the largest German newspaper – Süddeutsche Zeitung – alleges that the U.S. government helped Monsanto attack the computers of activists opposed to genetically modified food.

Track ‘Em and Whack ‘Em

The NSA is also helping to assassinate people. The Washington Post reports:

On the line with the SEAL was the drone operator and a “collector,” an NSA employee at the agency’s gigantic base at Fort Gordon in Augusta, Ga. The collector was controlling electronic surveillance equipment in the airspace over the part of Afghanistan where the CIA had zeroed in on one particular person. The SEAL pleaded with the collector to locate the cellphone in Afghanistan that matched the phone number that the SEAL had just given him, according to someone with knowledge of the incident who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The collector had never before done such a thing. Before even intercepting a cellphone conversation, he was accustomed to first confirming that the user was the person he had been directed to spy on. The conversation would then be translated, analyzed, distilled and, weeks later, if deemed to be interesting, sent around the U.S. intelligence community and the White House. On that day, though, the minutes mattered. “We just want you to find the phone!” the SEAL urged. No one cared about the conversation it might be transmitting. The CIA wanted the phone as a targeting beacon to kill its owner. The NSA collector in Georgia took what was then considered a gigantic leap — from using the nation’s most sophisticated spy technology to record the words of presidents, kings and dictators to using it to kill a single man in a terrorist group. The revolutionary significance of that and other similar operations was quickly grasped by intelligence officials. With analysts and technicians from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the NSA subsequently assembled a team in the basement of its headquarters called the Geolocation Cell, or Geo Cell. Its purpose was to track people, geographically, in real time. *** A motto quickly caught on at Geo Cell: “We Track ’Em, You Whack ’Em.” *** At the same time, the NSA supported a parallel effort by CIA paramilitary units and clandestine Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) teams tasked with capturing or killing al-Qaeda leaders, deemed “high-value targets.” NSA analysts and collectors moved into the JSOC commander’s new and growing operational headquarters in Balad, Iraq, which also serviced Afghanistan. *** By September 2004, a new NSA technique enabled the agency to find cellphones even when they were turned off. JSOC troops called this “The Find,” and it gave them thousands of new targets, including members of a burgeoning al-Qaeda-sponsored insurgency in Iraq, according to members of the unit.

Daily Kos notes:

So the NSA and CIA have been targeting drone strikes at cellphones without first taking the time to be clear who is carrying the phone and what they might be doing. That’s how you end up blowing up weddings, political meetings, and groups of teenagers hanging out at a cafe. Equally disturbing the NSA is collecting and storing information on every American with a cell phone that would allow them to quickly carry out their assassination via drone. (I should also add that if you have a 4G enabled tablet, it would seem the government can follow it even when turned off). Among the things the government absolutely should not be doing is secretly tracking citizens in a way that would allow for their extrajudicial killing. It is time we renewed the ban on the US government performing assassinations. Once that capability has been created it is far to easy to abuse.

It’s worth noting that the same unaccountable agency which decides who should be killed by drones also spies on all Americans.

Postscript: It’s Not Very Reassuring When …

Given the trends in America towards loss of Constitutional rights, the potential abuse of information gained through spying is troubling. We’re not saying that the government is doing every rotten thing you can imagine. And we’re not saying that the sky is falling.

But the following trends together they show that unchecked power could lead to bad results:

The government can – on a whim – label any American as a potential terrorist

Any criticism of government – even by Americans living on U.S. soil – could be labeled as terrorism by the American government

Indeed, because the core things which reporters do could be considered terrorism, in modern America, they could even targeted under counter-terrorism laws (and here). The American government has been instrumental in locking up journalists in America (and here), Yemen and elsewhere for the crime of embarrassing the U.S. government

The Department of Justice told a federal court that the courts cannot review the legality of the government’s assassination by drone of Americans abroad

One of the nation’s top constitutional and military law experts said that Obama claims the power to assassinate any American without charge and at his own discretion

The director of the FBI said he’d have to “check” to see if the president had the authority to assassinate Americans on U.S. soil

And that is no surprise. But while they've put 1 and two together, 1 and 2 have not met 3... yet.

Here's the one two:

As Petraeus testifies, Baghdad teeters on edge of erupting Army Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker were critical of Iran when they testified Tuesday before the Senate , barely giving credit for an Iranian-brokered cease-fire that curbed the killing after a week of Shiite-on-Shiite bloodshed in southern Iraq and Baghdad.

What a powerful and headline and opening paragraph. The 1 is the Iran involvement in the ""cease-fire"" (though it doesn't really apply to Westerners in Iraq...) and 2 is the inability of some to admit this fact.

Not the 3 is McCain and his gaffe (#4,020. . . . .).

""Apparently it was Sadr who asked for the ceasefire, declared a ceasefire. It wasn’t Maliki. Very rarely do I see the winning side declare a ceasefire. So we’ll see.’’

So we've got a baby step.

When the Crocker-Petraeus report comes in, questions should be raised not only be about the reality of the military progress (though there are many questions there to be asked) or about the stalled political process (though those should definitely be pushed hard). I would like to see more fundamental questions raised than quibbling over how to evaluate progress in this city or that province. Does this military strategy lead to the political outcome to which we are publicly committed? If the goal is to create a functional, inclusive Iraqi state, then are these tactics furthering that goal or undermining it? Or has the US changed its goals without acknowledging the change, giving up on a multi-ethnic centralized state and paving the way to soft partition?

Is the strategic trajectory we are currently on beneficial to the political track? The political outcome being the decisive component of the ""surge"" and a necessity to stabilizing the situation in Iraq. Here's what Lynch has stumbled upon in short form (but read the whole post here).

Basically, Ambassador Ryan Crocker is working from the top down on a national Iraqi government. This is the goal in Iraq; a strong, friendly (or at least neutral) central government. One the military track, General David Petraeus has been working locally. Providing arms and other aid to local clans so they can do what a typical government would do: provide security. Petraeus has had a little success, but there has been much less for Crocker. But the question is: Why would the Shiite central government reconcile with local Sunni's who are being armed and supported by the US? One obvious conclusion surfaces for Lynch, ""Petraeus's military 'successes' and local initiatives come at the expense of the national political track, not in support of it."" Maybe they expect to meet in the middle. That, of course, wouldn't be the ends were sold earlier this year.

Let's hope some members of Congress and and the media comprehend this point and ask tough questions of the pair in their mid-September briefing.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Crocker-Petraeus: Cross-Purposes in Iraq,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

The rules are are: • Have a defensible and achievable goal; • Live by your principles – don’t be goaded by the terrorist into behaving differently; • Know your enemy, intimately; • Isolate terrorists within their own communities; • Engage others in countering terrorism with you; • Have patience and keep your perspective – be prepared for the long-term; • Build a process which is unambiguous and can function strategically and operationally and in is open-ended.

In order of appearance... I don't think eradicating terrorism is a ""defensible"" goal. Limiting it and starving it of sustenance is better. President Bush seemed to be on the verge of getting this in his recent press conference when he said ""[i]t matters to the security of people here at home if we don't work to change the conditions that cause 19 kids to be lured onto airplanes to come and murder our citizens."" He was speaking of Iraq here so he still hasn't comprehended the fact that Iraq is precisely the condition he is referring to.

""Live by you principles."" Good God we have lost that round. PATRIOT ACT, FISA, unilateralism, torture, habeas corpus...

""Know your enemy."" What is the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite? And a Kurd? What is the difference al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and al Qaeda of 9/11 and all the other al Qaeda outfits. The difference between al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and a Baathist insurgent? They are not all the same and saying they are is lowest common denominator drivel for the masses and does nothing for the war and much for propaganda.

Isolate to terrorists. That's hard to do, especially when your actions facilitate there survival. They are everywhere, anywhere; but at the same time nowhere.

Accept the help of others. Mixed bag. We went into Afghanistan with the international community, although some (Rummy and Cheney) wanted otherwise. Those two won the argument as we went into Iraq (with little genuine international support). Now we're begging for a larger UN presence. And you know what? We're lucky for it. If the UN had the belligerence of some in the Bush Administration they'd ignore us. Furthermore, we skip opportunities to try to incorporate enemies (Syria and Iran) into our effort. Without exploring this avenue we not only dump the precedent of talking to our enemies we leave a stone unturned.

Prepare for the long-term. Meaning don't use (the threat of) terrorism for politics. Short-term gains against terrorism often give terrorist a rhetorical card to use in the long-term (justification for actions and recruitment). It should be clear that the ""long war"" will not be won with a military. Especially without a viable political track. Iraq is making that painfully clear.

Open-endedness. best covered by Quiggin: ""This will require training and practice exercises, as well as scenario planning and building capacity. Little point exists for working in stove pipes which merely come together, if at all, at the top level. Stated another way, we need to escape from the tyranny of the tactical and advance to a strategic, whole-of-government approach.""

Immediately relevant to this is Hersh's latest claims (h/t TP.org) via Reuters:

Despite the Bush administration’s insistence it has no plans to go to war with Iran, a Pentagon panel has been created to plan a bombing attack that could be implemented within 24 hours of getting the go-ahead from President George W. Bush, The New Yorker magazine reported in its latest issue. The special planning group was established within the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in recent months, according to an unidentified former U.S. intelligence official cited in the article by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh in the March 4 issue.

More from the UK Times article quoting British Intel:

""There is simply no stomach for it in the Pentagon, and a lot of people question whether such an attack would be effective or even possible.""

So which is it? No stomach or or internal panel planning war?

I'm working with a radio crew but have also been doing a little bit of blogging when possible... hasn't amounted to much. I thought I'd start a thread for the debate so we can chat.

We just got the live feed here so things are about to get rolling. A choir was singing and now they're3 going through the formalities (the good ol' Star Spangled Banner, and introductions of elites). I don't have much to say here, but the latest polls have Obama at around 45%, Hillary in the 30s and Edwards in the teens. After NH I don't thing that means much, until the real poll takes place Saturday.

7866,3275405,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/03/comparing-japans-radiation-release-to-background-radiation.html,"Apologists for the type of old, unsafe nuclear reactors which are leaking in Japan argue that the amount of radiation released from Fukushima is small compared to the amount of “background radiation”.

There Are NO Background Levels of Radioactive Caesium or Iodine

Wikipedia provides some details on the distribution of cesium-137 due to human activities:

Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Chernobyl disaster. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes with greatest health impact distributed by the reactor explosion. The mean contamination of caesium-137 in Germany following the Chernobyl disaster was 2000 to 4000 Bq/m2. This corresponds to a contamination of 1 mg/km2 of caesium-137, totaling about 500 grams deposited over all of Germany.Caesium-137 is unique in that it is totally anthropogenic. Unlike most other radioisotopes, caesium-137 is not produced from its non-radioactive isotope, but from uranium. It did not occur in nature before nuclear weapons testing began. By observing the characteristic gamma rays emitted by this isotope, it is possible to determine whether the contents of a given sealed container were made before or after the advent of atomic bomb explosions. This procedure has been used by researchers to check the authenticity of certain rare wines, most notably the purported “Jefferson bottles”.

As the EPA notes:

Cesium-133 is the only naturally occurring isotope and is non-radioactive; all

other isotopes, including cesium-137, are produced by human activity.

So there was no “background radiation” for caesium-137 before above-ground nuclear testing and nuclear accidents such as Chernobyl.

Japan has already, according to some estimates, released 50% of the amount of caesium-137 released by Chernobyl, and many experts say that the Fukushima plants will keep on leaking for months. See this and this. The amount of radioactive fuel at Fukushima dwarfs Chernobyl.

Likewise, iodine-131 is not a naturally occurring isotope. As the Encyclopedia Britannica notes:



The only naturally occurring isotope of iodine is stable iodine-127. An exceptionally useful radioactive isotope is iodine-131…

And New Scientist reports that huge quantities of iodine-131 are being released in Japan:

Austrian researchers have used a worldwide network of radiation detectors – designed to spot clandestine nuclear bomb tests – to show that iodine-131 is being released at daily levels 73 per cent of those seen after the 1986 disaster.

(Indeed, some experts are saying that the amount of radioactivity released in Japan already exceeds Chernobyl.)

Naturally-Occurring Radiation

There are, of course, naturally occurring radioactive materials.

But lumping all types of radiation together is misleading … and is comparing apples to oranges.

As the National Research Council’s Committee to Assess the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program explains:

Radioactivity generates radiation by emitting particles. Radioactive materials outside the the body are called external emitters, and radioactive materials located within the body are called internal emitters.

Internal emitters are much more dangerous than external emitters. Specifically, one is only exposed to radiation as long as he or she is near the external emitter.

For example, when you get an x-ray, an external emitter is turned on for an instant, and then switched back off.

But internal emitters steadily and continuously emit radiation for as long as the particle remains radioactive, or until the person dies – whichever occurs first. As such, they are much more dangerous.

Dr. Helen Caldicott and many other medical doctors and scientists have confirmed this. See this and this.

As Hirose Takashi notes:



All of the information media are at fault here I think. They are saying stupid things like, why, we are exposed to radiation all the time in our daily life, we get radiation from outer space. But that’s one millisievert per year. A year has 365 days, a day has 24 hours; multiply 365 by 24, you get 8760. Multiply the 400 millisieverts by that, you get 3,500,000 the normal dose. You call that safe? And what media have reported this? None. They compare it to a CT scan, which is over in an instant; that has nothing to do with it. The reason radioactivity can be measured is that radioactive material is escaping. What is dangerous is when that material enters your body and irradiates it from inside. These industry-mouthpiece scholars come on TV and what to they say? They say as you move away the radiation is reduced in inverse ratio to the square of the distance. I want to say the reverse. Internal irradiation happens when radioactive material is ingested into the body. What happens? Say there is a nuclear particle one meter away from you. You breathe it in, it sticks inside your body; the distance between you and it is now at the micron level. One meter is 1000 millimeters, one micron is one thousandth of a millimeter. That’s a thousand times a thousand: a thousand squared. That’s the real meaning of “inverse ratio of the square of the distance.” Radiation exposure is increased by a factor of a trillion. Inhaling even the tiniest particle, that’s the danger. [Interviewer] So making comparisons with X-rays and CT scans has no meaning. Because you can breathe in radioactive material. [Takashi] That’s right. When it enters your body, there’s no telling where it will go. The biggest danger is women, especially pregnant women, and little children. Now they’re talking about iodine and cesium, but that’s only part of it, they’re not using the proper detection instruments. What they call monitoring means only measuring the amount of radiation in the air. Their instruments don’t eat. What they measure has no connection with the amount of radioactive material. . . .

There are few natural high-dose internal emitters. Bananas, brazil nuts and some other foods contain radioactive potassium-40, but in extremely low doses.

As the American Journal of Public Health noted in 1962:



Of the radioisotopes originally present in rock-type formations, some may become internal emitters through natural processes. They may be leached or dissolved into ground and surface waters, thus gaining access to man’s water and food supply. For either physical or biological reasons, only a few of the naturally radioactive heavy atoms are important sources of internal radiation exposure . The three most important are believed to be radium 226, the most abundant natural isotope of radium; lead 210, a daughter of radium 226 and of radon 222, and radium 228, a daughter of natural thorium.

Radon 222 has a half life of less than 4 days. Radium has a much longer half-life. However,radium ions do not form complexes easily, due to highly basic character of ions. Radium compounds are quite rare, occurring almost exclusively in uranium ores.

Some parts of the country are at higher risk of exposure to naturally-occurring radium than others. It is not only those built on top of uranium mines. For example, the American Journal of Public Health article notes:

Water derived from surface sources such as rivers, lakes, or wells penetrating unconsolidated sand or gravel deposits were, in general, found to contain considerably lower concentrations of radium 226 than wells penetrating deep sandstone formations of Cambrian or pre-Cambrian ages.

In contrast, cesium-137 – one of the main types of radioactivity being spewed by the Japanese plants – has a much longer half life, and can easily contaminate food and water supplies. As the New York Times noted recently:

Over the long term, the big threat to human health is cesium-137, which has a half-life of 30 years. At that rate of disintegration, John Emsley wrote in “Nature’s Building Blocks” (Oxford, 2001), “it takes over 200 years to reduce it to 1 percent of its former level.” It is cesium-137 that still contaminates much of the land in Ukraine around the Chernobyl reactor. *** Cesium-137 mixes easily with water and is chemically similar to potassium. It thus mimics how potassium gets metabolized in the body and can enter through many foods, including milk.

As the EPA notes in a discussion entitled ” What can I do to protect myself and my family from cesium-137?”:

Cesium-137 that is dispersed in the environment, like that from atmospheric testing, is impossible to avoid.

Radioactive iodine can also become a potent internal emitter. As the Times notes:



Iodine-131 has a half-life of eight days and is quite dangerous to human health. If absorbed through contaminated food, especially milk and milk products, it will accumulate in the thyroid and cause cancer.

The bottom line is that there is some naturally-occurring background radiation, which can – at times – pose a health hazard (especially in parts of the country with high levels of radioactive radon or radium).

But cesium-137 and radioactive iodine – the two main radioactive substances being spewed by the leaking Japanese nuclear plants – are not naturally-occurring substances, and can become powerful internal emitters which can cause tremendous damage to the health of people who are unfortunate enough to breathe in even a particle of the substances, or ingest them in food or water. Unlike low-levels of radioactive potassium found in bananas – which our bodies have adapted to over many years – cesium-137 and iodine 131 are brand new, extremely dangerous substances.

And unlike naturally-occurring internal emitters like radon and radium – whose distribution is largely concentrated in certain areas of the country – radioactive cesium and iodine are spreading not only nationally, but world-wide.

At the very least, it is important to note that each individual internal emitters behaves differently. They each accumulate in different places in the body, target different organs, mimic different vitamins and minerals, and are excreted differently (or not at all). Therefore, comparing radioactive cesium or iodine with naturally occurring radioactive substances – even those which can become internal emitters – is incorrect and misleading.

This is not to say that we’re all going to get cancer. Most of use probably won’t. This is solely an attempt to counter the misleading propaganda from apologists for old, unsafe nuclear reactors.

The Bible and Nobel Prize Winning Economists Agree: “When The Sentence For A Crime Is Not Quickly Carried Out, People’s Hearts Are Filled With Schemes To Do Wrong”

Preface: If you are an atheist and believe that religion is crazy, please remember that some 85% of the American population identifies itself as Christian and millions more identify themselves as Jewish. Very few Americans are atheists. (And the majority don’t trust atheists.) Therefore, knowing a few bible verses may be essential for atheists to be able to speak to people of faith.



The head of Goldman Sachs said he’s doing “God’s work” with his banking activities. The head of Barclays also told his congregation that banking as practiced by his company was not antithetical to Christian principles.

Are they right? Is big banking as practiced by the giant banks in harmony with Christian or traditional Jewish principles?

Do Justice

Initially, the Bible does not counsel us to ignore the breaking of laws by the the powerful.

In fact, the Bible mentions justice over 200 times — more than just about any other topic. The Bible asks us to do justice and to stand up to ANYONE — including the rich or powerful — who do injustice or oppress the people.



Indeed, one of the first things God asks of us is to do justice:

He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God? (Micah 6:8)

While many churches and synagogues have become obsessed with other issues, many have arguably ignored this most important of God’s demands of us. As pointed out by a leading Christian ministry, which rescues underage girls trapped as sex slaves in third world countries:

In Scripture there is a constant call to seek justice. Jesus got upset at the Pharisees because they neglected the weightier matters of the law, which He defined as justice and the love of God . . . Isaiah 58 complains about the fact that while the people of God are praying and praying and praying, they are not doing anything about the injustice.

Should Christians just pray for justice and leave the rest to God?

That’s not what the Bible asks us to do. Instead, Hebrews 11:33 tells us that we are God’s hands for dispensing justice, and God uses us to “administer justice.”

We have to “walk our talk” and put our prayers into action.

God demands that we do everything in our power to act as “God’s hands” in bringing justice. And as Saint Augustine reminds us, “Charity is no substitute for justice withheld.”

Indeed:

The Lord looked and was displeased that there was no justice. He saw that there was no one, He was appalled that there was no one to intervene. (Isaiah 59:15-16)

This is the only place in the Bible where the word “appalled” is used for the way God feels — in other words, the only thing which we know God is appalled by is if people are not doing justice.

There are hundreds of other references to justice in the Bible, including:

Blessed are they who maintain justice . . . . (Psalm 106:3)

This is what the LORD says: Maintain justice and do what is right . . . . (Isiah 56:1)

This is what the LORD says: Do what is just and right. (Jeremiah 22:3,13-17)

Follow justice and justice alone. (Deuteronomy 16:19, 20)

For the LORD is righteous, he loves justice . . . . (Job 11:5,7)

Learn to do right! Seek justice . . . . (Isaiah 1:17)

But shouldn’t we be deferential to the rich and powerful bankers?

No. Colossians 3:25 explains:

For the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done, without respect for any man’s position.

So if the powerful players in the giant banks broke the laws, they must be held to account.

Fraud and Manipulation of Money

The big banks have engaged in systemic, continuous ongoing criminal fraud.

Allowing the banks to commit crime with impunity is not what Jesus would do. What would Jesus do? Turn over the tables of the money-changers. (economists agree.)

Moreover, the giant banks are manipulating every market in the world.

As Ron Paul notes, the Bible forbids altering the quality of money (which, at the time and place, was entirely in the form of coins):

Even the Bible is clear that altering the quality of money is an immoral act. We are instructed to follow the rules of “just weights and measures.” “You shall do no injustice in judgment, in measurement of length, weight, or volume. You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin” (Leviticus 19:35-36). “Diverse weights are an abomination to the LORD, and a false balance is not good” (Proverbs 20:23). The general principle can be summed as “You shall not steal.”

Proverbs 11:1 also provides:

Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD, but a just weight is His delight.

So to the extent that the giant banks have engaged in any dishonest acts or the manipulation of currencies, they are violating scripture.

Oppression of the Poor

Finally, the Bible condemns oppression of the poor for the benefit of the affluent:

He that oppresses the poor to increase his riches, and he that gives to the rich, shall surely come to want. (Proverbs 22:16)

To the extent that the giant banks have oppressed the poor to increase their riches, they are violating scripture.

Shouldn’t We Wait Until the Economy Recovers?

Apologists for Wall Street criminals argue that we should wait until the economy recovers before we prosecute the criminals.

But Ecclesiastes 8:11 notes:

When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people’s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong.

Nobel prize winning economists agree.

Important Postscript: Not all bankers are bad people. For example, many bankers at smaller banks and credit unions are good people who are trying to help their communities. Each must be judged by his own acts.

Moreover, corrupt government officials are half the problem. Indeed, the big banks wouldn’t have grown so large, or gotten away with so many bad acts, had corrupt officials in Washington not condoned their actions.

The Wall Street criminals themselves are not the real problem. The deeper problem is the malignant, symbiotic relationship between corrupt government officials and corrupt bankers.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Or Atheists Who Want to Talk With Them,"Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد, William Walton",,[''],,,,

Speaking in London he also said that he expected the country's deficit would be 5.5 percentage points lower by the end of the year. ""Greece is not Ireland, it doesn't have banking stability problems,"" he said in a speech.Well, I'd say Minister Lenihan could have said 'We are not Greece, we don't have a liquidity crisis... yet'... but then he won't be really far from his usual rhetorical corner. For another Reuters story tonight showed that we are heading for a possible liquidity crunch:""LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - A widening in bid/offer spreads on Irish and Portuguese sovereign bonds this month is possibly an even bigger worry than the rising premium these bonds offer over German Bunds or widening credit default spreads.Liquidity is the grease in the wheels of financial markets and if there is a reduction in liquidity then this will show up in the way prices move and in bid/offer spreads.While the bid/offer spread on the Irish 10-year cash bond is not as wide as it was before the European Central Bank said in May it was prepared to buy government bonds in the secondary market, it has definitely broken higher.Since the ECB's May announcement, the bid/offer spread had largely stayed below 30 basis points. However, it has now widened to 40 basis points.Ignoring such price action in its early stages can be risky since it could lead to a vicious spiral. This is what happened with Greek debt in March when a widening in bid/offer spreads was ignored, leading to a significant deterioration in the supply/demand dynamics.Those holding long positions became increasingly keen to dump their holdings while those who might have potentially taken on new long positions refrained for fear of catching the proverbial falling knife.What has been of concern over the last few sessions is that the widening in bid/offer spreads has also started to shift to the medium- to short-end of the yield curve.There has even been an acceleration in the widening in the bid/offer spreads for two-year and five-year Irish sovereign debt.This widening has continued even though the latest data shows the European Central Bank resumed its government bond buying programme after a three-week pause.That suggests the ECB needs to step up its intervention beyond the 711 million euros it spent last week if it is to meet its aim of ensuring ""depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional"".Unless there is a marked escalation in the ECB's bond purchases, contagion-related risks suggest the potential for a further widening in Spanish yield spreads against Bunds. Against this backdrop, investors might prefer to focus on the relative value trade of a widening in the 10-year Spain/Italy yield spread.""Ouch!",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Irish crisis, Irish bonds, ECB, Euro crisis, Irish Government, Irish bonds crisis, Liquidity crisis, QE, Irish debt, euro liquidity",,

Steer the bank out of trouble? Not really, Anglo is not any better today than a year ago. Carry out its ordinary business? Not really, Anglo is not doing any new business at all and is in effect sitting pretty until Nama cleans up the mess. Safeguard public 'investment'? Not really, for no one sane really expects any return from this 'investment'. So what exactly do these 'Public Interest' director do? No one dares to ask.



In the mean time, Alan Dukes and Frank Daly - two, in my view fine individuals - collect public retirement pay and are receiving €99,360 each in fees from a publicly-owned Anglo. A figure more than six times the compensation for directors of other State bodies.

But things are not much better in BofI (where Tom Considine and Joe Walsh received total fees to €102,375 and Joe Walsh's to €78,750). AIB in contrast paid Dick Spring and Declan Collier €27,375 and also topped these with €3,000 for each committee meeting attended. IL&P's public guardians, Ray MacSharry (fees of €56,250) and Margaret Hayes (€63,500) were handsomely well off as well. At EBS, Tony Spollen and Ann Riordan both receive a basic fee of €29,000 each. State appointed noble folks of Nationwide, Rory O'Ferrall and Adrian Kearns, in line with a long-running tradition at the building society to behave like a secretive private bank, simply didn't disclose their earnings to the public.

Further irony: fully state-owned Anglo pays second highest rate to its non-execs, while the Irish Government is flustered with privately held banks (AIB & BofI and the rest of privately held 5) executives' remuneration. It looks like someone (Minister Lenihan?) can't control his own organization (Anglo), while trying to play tough with organizations he has little stake in. Oh, incidentally, the fees for Dukes & co were set on the 'recommendation' by the State own 'commission' - another state body that Minister Lenihan apparently cannot reign in.

Expected annual cost (inclusive of expected, but not disclosed fees) €760,000 plus.



After having a quick chat with few friends in academia, here is a bold proposal for the Minister for Finance - you can find at least 12 senior and experienced academics and industry practitioners, including my self, who would do these jobs for €10,000 per annum plus expenses. As a real exercise in our patriotic (Minister Lenihan's words from last Budget) duty.

How about it, Minister? You promise left right and center that you will save taxpayers money. Here is a chance to do so. Some €640,000 of taxpayers money!





Oh and while we are on the topic of silly/dodgy political news - there is a recent report in the US (here) that argues that President Obama evokes Jesus and God more frequently than his predecessor. Not that I have a problem with this myself, but I wonder what all the European 'Liberals' would make of this...

after

first

""We had added €23bn to our General Government Debt to GDP ratio as a result of Anglo to leave it at 98.1% at year end 2011. This additional €1.4bn now needs to be added and will add approximately 0.7% to our debt to GDP figure at year end 2011."" Yeps, with Anglo latest request for funding, Ireland Inc sovereign debt is set to be 99% by the end of 2011.



The NCB guys are also aware, unlike, it appears Davy and Goodies, that Anglo can end up costing us (taxpayers) of sovereign bonds side as well: ""The NTMA announced that its next auction on Tuesday August 17th it will tap the 4.0% 15 January 2014 bond and the 5.0% 18 October 2020 bond. The NTMA will be hoping that the Anglo issue is cleared up sooner rather than later and that clarity is given on the final requirement by the State. The uncertainty surrounding the exact amount of the transfer into Anglo is weighing on the Irish sovereign. The Irish 10 year is currently at 5.16% which is 274bps over the equivalent German bond and wider than the benchmark Portuguese 10 year which is yielding 5.079%.""

Sovereign risk rising due to Anglo uncertainty, and Corporate risk is also rising due to spillover from sovereign uncertainty to corporate assets valuations.

1/7 of the total book (€10bn) under water to Nama or better than Nama levels - say impairment of 30% due;

35% (or €25bn destined for the 'Bad' bank) is under water more than Nama haircuts - say 60-70% impairment due.

For about 24 hours I have resisted commenting on the Anglo latest twist in the capital hole - the EU approval yesterday of additional funding for the dead bank. But given the lack of straight forward and insightful analysis in the media, I thought I should throw int couple of direct comments on the affair.First, consider the EU statement (available here ):Sadly, no Irish commentator noticed the irony that the EU is calling for a profound restructuring of the Anglo3 episodes of approvals of extraordinary funding for the bank by the taxpayers. Surely, if the Commission were to do its job and properly police national decisions relating to financial institutions stability, after the second call for capital from Anglo, Mr Almunia should have said something along the following lines: ""Don't come back for any additional funds approval until youprovide a clear map as to how you are planning to shut down this insolvent institution.""Second, consider the timing of the approval. For some days before the approval, Irish 'analysts' and policy officials have been massaging public opinion. Various leaks and speculative statements that the bank will need more cash were floated around. Some of the Irish brokerages suggested that Anglo will need €2-4bn more in funding. Of course, while this circus was ongoing, the Government has been quietly labouring away at the submission to the EU Commission. The approval was issued on Tuesday, suggesting that the request for emergency funding extension was filed at the very latest - on Friday. This request was not subject to any parliamentary debate or other procedures that should have been deployed to ensure democratic participation in disbursing of the public money was adhered to.Third consider Irish media and 'analysts' response to the Anglo call for cash. Of all stockbrokers, only NCB managed to comment on the Anglo call, despite the fact that Anglo's capital demands are indicative of the sector-wide problems. NCB guys actually did a good job in their morning note, saying that:Of course, most of the media have missed the two points of Anglo contagion to the broader markets:Finally, the whole circus around Anglo's 'news' missed the core point - Anglo started into the present mess with €71bn of 'assets' (aka loans). The total amount earmarked to date for the bank amounts to €24.354bn.If Nama were to be believed in its LTEV estimates, Anglo's book is roughly 55% under water. This means that its post-Nama book is somewhere closer to being:Translated to the full pre-crisis book, this implies the average recovery rate on Anglo loans of ca 43-47% across the whole book.Let me explain the above numbers: €10bn recoverable at 70% and 25bn recoverable at 30-40% implies 14.5bn recovery on 35bn of assets left post-Nama, adding to it Nama haircuts implies recovery rate of 43-47%, ex-costs). This, in turn, implies across the book impairments of €37.6-40.5bn. Take the lower number - total through restructuring cost of Anglo can be expected to reach ca €37bn in the end or higher. Take 10% off for risk-weighting and restructurings of funding etc to boost regulatory capital.End of the Anglo affair cost comes to roughly speaking €33bn. That's the amount we can expect to pay in the end. The latest €24.4bn count is, therefore, only less than 3/4 of the saga. So here's my forecast - by end 2011 Anglo will ask for ca €10bn more in our cash and by the end of 2012 - for up to €13bn more than the amounts already advanced. The only way these figures can be made smaller is if Nama grossly overpays Anglo for Tranche 2 and 3 loans.Anyone noticed that? Not really. Just as no one noticed that Anglo is going to, in the end, cost every working person in this country something of the order of €19,600 - a hefty bill for rescuing Anglo's bondholders for every household of two trying to pay a (negative equity) mortgage and get kids through school.Instead, our media keeps on asking Minister Lenihan rhetorical questions along the lines 'How much more?' and lamenting 'unexpected Anglo demands for more cash'. Per all publicly available information on this site, Peter Mathews' site and Irish Economy site, all I can say: ""Expect more of the 'unexpected', folks"".",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Irish banking crisis, Minister Lenihan, Irish banks, Anglo-Irish Bank, Nama and Anglo Irish Bank, Irish banks guarantee, Irish banking, Anglo Irish Bank, Exclusive Anglo Irish Bank, Anglo guarantee, Anglo losses",,

These charts illustrate the comment I provided to the Quarterly Journal of Central Banking - forthcoming issue for Q3 2011. First, straight forward composition of liabilities as shown in the chart above.Next, the same expressed as percentages of total liabilities: Finally, assumptions and calculations of total implicit subsidy from the Irish taxpayers/Exchequer to foreign liabilities holders: Click on the chart to enlarge and see assumptions and calculations. Euro area residents accounted for €39.572 billion of our banks' liabilities or 6.42%, while non-Euro area residents accounted for €218.836 billion or 35.5% of total Ireland-6 liabilities at the time the Guarantee was issued. Thus, Euro area residents received an implicit subsidy from the Irish taxpayers to the tune of €5.5-6.7 billion over the time of the Guarantee - well in excess of the life-time cost of 1% reduction in the interest rate on our EU loans.Of course, this is a crude estimate based on official provided and expected default rates on assets held by the Irish banks - excluding Anglo and INBS. Which means it is likely to be an under-estimate. Expected losses at INBS and Anglo are multiples of those assumed for the Ireland-4 covered in the main PCARs. With Anglo & INBS thrown into the mix, subsidy to Euro area residents rises to ca €8 billion.Another issue here is that I am using estimates through 2013 only. This means that, like the CBofI I am assuming (ad hoc) that post-2013 IRL-6 will be able to cover their own losses without resorting to taxpayers capital injections. This assumption, in my view, is absolutely unrealistic.Finally, no allowance is made here for the Irish Government underwriting of the funding debts incurred by the banks vis-a-vis ECB and CBofI - the debts which, at least in the case of Anglo & INBS, should be treated as largely reckless lending to insolvent institutions and which should not be a liability of the taxpayers.In the end, in my opinion, Irish Government had no business underwriting a Guarantee for any of the liabilities in excess of €130.2 billion of domestic deposits and €2.813 billion of its own deposits with the IRL-6.Note - another issue not addressed in these estimates, but also likely to increase the implicit subsidy extended to Euro area residents is that Monetary & Financial Institutions deposits figures cover IRL-20 banks regulated here, which include a large number of deposits from Euro area banks that are within IRL-20.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Irish Guarantee 2008, Debt Irish banks, cost of Irish banks bailout, Irish bank losses, Irish banks guarantee",,

""The message from the (European) Central Bank to Dublin was the same as the message from the Central Bank to Germany, to Belgium, to France, and we were at the heat of the crisis saying clearly, beware. We know what happens after we had Lehman Brothers.""In fairness to Trichet, as he claimed yesterday, the ECB did warn on numerous occasions that prior to the crisis, there was a growing cost competitiveness gap across the euro area and that fiscal performance was insufficient for a number of countries in the region.More on the story is here: http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe/ireland-s-bank-guarantee-was-justifiable-claims-trichet-1.1655216 One way or the other, the Trichet's testimony now opens up room for the Government to put into public domain the content of the controversial letters that Trichet wrote to Minister Lenihan back in 2010 as well as full correspondence between ECB and Irish authorities back in 2008. Let's see what advice was exactly given to Ireland by the ECB on the Guarantee and subsequently.H/T to Seamus Coffey's: the letters that are yet to be released relate to 2010 exchanges between Mr Trichet and Brian Lenihan.However, we still do not know as to what exact advice was given to Mr Lenihan by Mr Trichet and the ECB before the Guarantee of 2008. As far as I am aware, back in September 2008 there was no official ECB position on any government issuing guarantees to cover the liabilities in their banking sector. Even after Ireland issued its guarantee, there was no such position publicly formulated. In fact, Irish Government notified the ECB, the Ecofin and the Eurogroup of its decision to guarantee the banks liabilities ex-post issuing the guarantee. It did so at the same time as making the Guarantee public. The closest we know of that the Government came to potentially receiving any wisdom from the ECB of the Guarantee could have been during a phone call between Mr Trichet and Minister Lenihan that took place a week before the Guarantee issuance.

Seanad

In a follow up to my post on the issues of adoption between Ireland and Russia and Vietnam ( here ) - and a large number of responses I received to it - yesterday there was a debate on the issue at the, the transcript of which is available here Given thatsite provides collapsed entries for each statement on the issue and since the debate took place in the context of the debate on the order of business (so the adoption issue is mixed within other statements), here are the parts of the debate that relate to the topic. My quick analysis of what happened follows this copy of therecord.Emphasis is mine, throughout.

Senator John Hanafin: I raise the issue of adoptions from Russia and Vietnam. In particular, I am cognisant that the difficulty that has arisen could be ameliorated through serious bilateral negotiations, notwithstanding the fact that all organisations, including the Health Service Executive, have limitations. Whereas normal criteria are applied prior to adoption, I understand post-placement requests have become extremely vigorous. If a little understanding were shown, it could help the HSE and put the matter in context..

[Senator Hanafin subsequently votes against a proposal to bring in Minister Barry Andrews for questions on the issue that he so passionately supports in this statement]



Senator Ivana Bacik: It is important to debate the treatment of children today. It is extraordinary that this Government has time to legislate for an outdated and dangerous offence of blasphemous libel--- and yet no time, apparently, to ensure the impasse between the HSE and the Ombudsman for Children is resolved and ensure the bilateral agreements for adoptions in Vietnam and Russia are resolved.

[Senator Bacik subsequently votes in favour of a proposal to bring in Minister Barry Andrews for questions on the issue]

Senator Mary M. White: Like my colleagues, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to come in and explain the difficulties faced by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, which led to her suspending her investigation into the HSE’s handling of the child protection audit of Catholic Church dioceses. The HSE should be absolutely transparent as a public body and should be forced to co-operate fully with the Ombudsman’s investigation...

When the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, was here to discuss the Adoption Bill he was exemplary in his understanding and comprehension of the legislation. I remember my colleagues on the other side of the House praised him for his dedication and understanding. It is critical we get to grips with the situation regarding adoptions in Russia and Vietnam. When I spoke on the Bill I said we must have compassion for the parents who are waiting to adopt children and for the children who are aching to be brought into a loving family...

[Senator White subsequently votes against a proposal to bring in Minister Barry Andrews for questions on the issue that she so passionately supports in her statement]

Senator Fidelma Healy Eames: I am pleased there is support on both sides of the House for an urgent clarification by the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, on the adoption crisis currently being experienced by families in this State. As an adoptive parent, I know what it is like to go through the process of adopting a child. As we speak, the applications of 24 Irish couples are delayed in Hanoi because the Minister of State has dropped the ball.

In the first week of March, we debated the provisions of the Adoption Bill 2009 in this House. Senator Fitzgerald and I told the Minister of State it was critical that the bilateral agreement should be in place by 1 May. His failure to act is hurting families, including the 250 couples who are ready to submit their applications to the Vietnamese authorities. The Minister of State has also dropped the ball in regard to Russia. Irish couples successfully adopted 484 babies from Vietnam and Russia last year, accounting for 84% of inter-country adoptions. I implore Members on the other side of the House to come together us on this issue. I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, be invited to the Chamber this afternoon to update us on the situation. I cannot answer all the e-mails I am receiving from people asking questions about it.

[Senator Eames subsequently votes in favour of calling in Minister Barry Andrews for questions on the issue]

Senator Ciaran Cannon: I refer to the matter of adoption. I have much respect, as does Senator Norris, for the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews. He has brought fresh thinking and enthusiasm to that Ministry. However, the energy and effort invested in the attempt to get the agreement with Vietnam re-established took place far too late. It began in earnest in March and the Minister of State should have made it a priority. He should have gone to Vietnam to establish what the issues were and how they could be resolved.

[Senator Cannon subsequently votes for a proposal to bring in Minister Barry Andrews for questions on the issue]

Senator Nicky McFadden: I also support Senator Fitzgerald’s comments on the bilateral agreement. I agree with Senator Norris about the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews. He is a good, caring Minister of State but why in God’s name did he only start negotiations in earnest on 25 March? Why did he not go to Vietnam, as Senator Cannon said? We need to put ourselves in the position of the families who, after five years of negotiation, are going to get their packs, information and deposits back from Vietnam and such places. That will be heartbreaking and soul destroying for people, not to mention the effect it will have on the extended families. Given that 1,000 families are waiting in this situation, it is incumbent on us to sort it out as soon as possible.

[Senator McFadden subsequently votes for a proposal to bring in Minister Barry Andrews for questions on the issue]

An Cathaoirleach: Senator Fitzgerald has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, “That a debate with the Minister for Health and Children on international adoptions, the suspension of the inquiry by the Ombudsman for Children and plans for child care places be taken today”. Is the amendment being pressed?

The success of these interventions, difficult as they are to assess, is mixed at best with Korea and Kosovo as examples of where positive outcomes occurred (in Haiti, a descent into complete chaos was perhaps prevented). Some turned out worse, given what followed.

As JPMorgan's Michael Cembalest notes, on a purely humanitarian basis, Syria’s tragedy is exceeded by many conflicts that the US abstained from participating in. So when thinking about civil wars and how the US defines its national interest, one has to ask why Syria would qualify for direct intervention while others conflicts did not.

True, there may still be some bubbles leaking:



br>

However, that might just be naturally-occurring methane being released from the seafloor.

For example, this video made by University of Mississippi researchers in the Gulf in 2006 – years before the BP blowout – shows methane bubbles rising naturally from the seafloor (when contained by a test tube, they turn into snowflake-like methane hydrate crystals).

As I noted in June, areas in close proximity to the BP well have long been known to have enormous amounts of methane and methane hydrates. And see this.

Indeed, as oil disaster expert Dr. Robert Bea pointed out in May:

About a month before the blowout, a “kick” of gas pressure hit the well hard enough that the platform was shut down. “Something under high pressure was being encountered,” says Bea—apparently both hydrates and gas on different occasions.

Sealing the well wouldn’t necessarily close off all of the normal avenues for methane bubbles to escape from the seafloor in a high-methane region. Therefore, I’m not sure that the small bubbles seen after the relief well was completed mean much.

But What About the Nearby Seeps?

A more interesting question concerns the seeps.

As Dr. Bea explained to me last month:

WB: Is it possible that this fractured, subsea salt geology will make it difficult to permanently kill the oil leak using relief wells? Bea: Yes, it could. The Santa Barbara channel seeps are still leaking, decades after the oil well was supposedly capped. This well could keep leaking for years. Scripps mapped out seafloor seeps in the area of the well prior to the blowout. Some of the natural seeps penetrate 10,000 to 15,000 feet beneath the seafloor. The oil will follow lines of weakness in the geology. The leak can travel several horizontal miles from the location of the leak. [In other words, the geology beneath the seafloor is so fractured, with soft and unstable salt formations, that we may never be able to fully kill the well even with relief wells. Instead, the loss of containment of the oil reservoir caused by the drilling accident could cause oil to leak out through seeps for years to come. See this and this for further background].

As I wrote in June:

The deep sea subs have found other leaks a couple of miles from BP’s gushing blowout preventer and riser. For example, the Houston Chronicle noted on June 21st: A report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Monday noted research vessels found natural gas seeping from the sea floor several miles away from the well. *** The Chronicle goes on to explain: Those appear to be pre-existing seeps that occur naturally, a NOAA spokeswoman said, and unrelated to the spill. But the Washington Post made a very important point yesterday: Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University, said additional leaks are a possible source of deep-sea plumes of oil detected by research vessels. But this part of the gulf is pocked with natural seeps, he noted. Conceivably the drilling of the well, and/or the subsequent blowout, could have affected the seeps, he said. “Once you started disturbing the underground geology, you may have made one of those seeps even worse,” he said. Remember that geologists have said that if the well casing is substantially breached, the oil and methane gas will find a way through fractures in the surrounding geology and make it into the ocean. For example, the Houston Chronicle notes: If the well casing burst it could send oil and gas streaming through the strata to appear elsewhere on the sea floor …. Obviously, if there are natural oil or gas seeps nearby, there are already pre-existing channels up to the seafloor … so that may very well be the path of least resistance for the subterranean oil to flow up to the seafloor. Therefore, if there were a substantial breach in the well bore, nearby natural oil and gas seeps could very well increase in volume. *** So don’t be surprised if – when formerly tiny seeps become gushers – BP tries to pretend that they were always that large.

As I noted in July:

The Times-Picayune reported yesterday: Scientists have discovered four gas “seeps” at or near BP’s blown-out Macondo well since Saturday … *** Berkeley engineering professor Bob Bea has very little confidence in what’s been said publicly about the seeps. He’s troubled that we’re just now hearing about seeps three kilometers away, because a survey of the seabed conducted before BP drilled its well didn’t indicate anything like that. “There was nothing that indicated the presence of such a seep,” Bea said. “I wonder why we’re just now finding that out?” BP has yet to release other ROV video that Bea’s study group requested more than a month ago about what may have been shots of nearby seeps.

(Bea explained to me last month: “In May, … Senator Boxer subpoenaed information from BP regarding footage of the seafloor taken before the blowout by BP’s remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). We still have not received a response 12 weeks later.”)

I also noted in July:

Thad Allen said today that there are anomalies on the seafloor within 100-200 meters of the blown out well. And oil expert Bob Cavner told MSNBC today: You know, these seeps that the admiral talked about within 100 meters of the well concern me some… The ones close really concern me. And there is a possibility, if you look at the well diagram which is complicated and I won’t get into it. There is a path for oil and gas to get out into the sub strata. And I’m concerned about that. Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy *** A 20-year petroleum geologist – with 13 years spent in offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico – “gasmiinder” noted yesterday: Mapping of natural methane seeps is required as part of the process of obtaining a drilling permit in the Gulf of Mexico. This is required because the “methane seep communities” are considered environmental “havens” as it were – you have to demonstrate you’re not disturbing the critters. [My comment: There are ecosystems which can thrive around small natural seeps. But huge gushers like the BP blow out can kill everything in sight, especially given the large amounts of methane which have spewed from BP’s well]. The process does not measure the rate of seepage but you would have some guess based on the areal extent of the communities. This report is filed with the MMS and should be available. I’m surprised and enterprising reporter hasn’t requested a copy from the MMS. (Of course enterprising reporter might be an oxymoron in the modern era) I attended a scientific talk about 20 years ago where the study results estimated about 1 million barrels of oil a year seep into the Gulf from natural seeps. Of course that is spread over a huge area on an entire year. In response to the above post, blogger CD notes that page 16 of BP’s Initial Exploration Plan for the well states: There is no evidence for the existence of high-density chemosynthetic communities within 1,500 ft of the proposed well location. Gasmiinder responds: The statement regarding the chemosynthetic communities requires a seafloor survey – that’s what I’m referring too where there will be a report available having mapped them (the partners will have copies of that report as well). Gasmiinder adds: Here is a copy from the webpage of a company that consults on the interpretation of the hazard surveys. It should give at least a feel for the level of information that is believed to be present in the data (meaning this is what they claim to be able to accomplish with the datasets): • Assess seafloor conditions and stratigraphy, and geologic processes to evaluate well site locations • Identify shallow gas and shallow water flow potential [my note: they are referring to shallow layers that could be hazards to drill through) • Interpret and map geologic constraints, such as faults, gas vents, seafloor depressions and mounds, and any other geologic phenomena that are detectable with seismic data • Identify potential chemosynthetic communities, archaeological sites, and man-made infrastructure and debris • Assess mooring spread, anchor locations, and foundation zones • Produce supporting maps to show water depth, topography, shallow structure, and seafloor and shallow geologic conditions and features in an area that may have an impact on drilling • Prepare final reports needed for permit application to governmental and insurance bodies So BP (and its partners in the well, Anadarko and Mitsui) would have maps of all of the nearby seeps which were there before well blew out.

Moreover, Dr. Bea told me last month that there might be other leaks near the Macondo wellhead:

WB: The chief electronics technician on the Deepwater Horizon said that the Macondo well was originally drilled in another location, but that “going faster caused the bottom of the well to split open, swallowing tools”, and that BP abandoned that well. You’ve spoken to that technician and looked into the incident, and concluded that “they damn near blew up the rig.” [See this and this]. Do you know where that abandoned well location is, and do you know if that well is still leaking? Bea: The abandoned well is very close to the current well location. BP had to file reports showing the location of the abandoned well and the new well [with the Minerals Management Service], so the location of the abandoned well is known. We don’t know if the abandoned well is leaking. WB: Matthew Simmons talked about a second leaking well. There are rumors on the Internet that the original well is still leaking. Do you have any information that can either disprove or confirm that allegation? Bea: There are two uncorroborated reports. One is that there is a leak 400 feet West of the present well’s surface location. There is another report that there is a leak several miles to the West. [Bea does not know whether either report is true at this time, because BP is not sharing information with the government, let alone the public.]

The bottom line is that I believe that the Macondo well has successfully been capped by the relief well.

And I have no evidence that there is increased seep activity after the relief well was completed.

But the government and BP must do the following before we can have reassurances that there are no nearby seeps which are now larger because of the April disaster:

It is very difficult to obtain accurate information on the dangers from Fukushima radiation to residents of the West Coast of North America and Hawaii.

On the one hand, there is fear-mongering and “we’re all going to die” type hysteria.

On the one hand, there is a tendency for governments to cover up the truth to avoid panic and deflect blame for bad policy. Japan is poised to pass a bill which would outlaw most reporting on Fukushima. And the U.S. government is not even monitoring radiation levels in the waters off the U.S. coast. As the Cape Cod Times reports:

With the first plume of water carrying radionuclides from Fukushima due to hit the U.S. West Coast any day now, [the senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Ken Buesseler’s] latest project is to convince the federal government to monitor radiation levels in the sea water. “We don’t have a U.S. agency responsible for radiation in the ocean,” Buesseler said. “It’s really bizarre.” *** He spent this past week in Washington, D.C., meeting with representatives of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy, asking them to come up with some sort of plan to keep tabs on levels of radionuclides in the ocean.

Buesseler also talked with U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who agreed the federal government has a role in making sure the oceans are healthy and safe. But Markey said in an email that an increased federal role is not likely [because of budget cuts].

Indeed, Dr. Buesseler points out the circular reasoning which the government is using (at 10:00):

I completely agree that no radiation has been seen in the regards that we’re not really testing for it [laughter] in any organized way … We have very few data; it’s not really being organized. The government says we don’t really need to do that because we’re predicting very low levels. On the other hand, you could argue I’d very much like to see study on our side of the ocean just to confirm these values and build some confidence with the public that’s been concerned about this. They’re right to be concerned — as scientists we’re telling them they shouldn’t be, but it’d be nice to have a few more data points to fill that gap … I’ve been told that there’s very little testing going on.

People are certainly concerned. As the Wall Street Journal notes:

Water containing radioactive materials has been leaking from storage tanks and drains at the plant into groundwater and the nearby ocean, raising concerns across the world that currents might spread radioactivity to faraway places.

But people don’t know where to get accurate information on the risks involved.

This essay provides reliable information on what is really going on … based upon the known science. It’s divided into 3 sections:

I. Is Low-Level Radiation Dangerous … Or Harmless?

II. How Much Radiation Will We Be Exposed To?

III. How Can We Protect Ourselves from Radiation?

I. Is Low-Level Radiation Dangerous … Or Harmless?

You may have heard different claims about whether low-level radiation is dangerous … or harmless.

Fox News reports:

Doug Dasher, who [teaches] radioecology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said it remains possible that there will be minor effects for people on the U.S. West Coast, despite the low test results. “No acute effects resulting in mortality or damage to organs … would be expected,” he told FoxNews.com. But he added that more subtle effects might occur. “Longer term chronic effects, cancer or genetic effects… odds are statistically low, if the concentrations in the models remain within the projections, [but] cannot be said to be zero.”

What is Dasher saying? That even low levels of radiation from Fukushima can increase the risk of cancer and other diseases.

A major 2012 scientific study proves that low-level radiation can cause huge health problems. Science Daily reports:

Even the very lowest levels of radiation are harmful to life, scientists have concluded in the Cambridge Philosophical Society’s journal Biological Reviews. Reporting the results of a wide-ranging analysis of 46 peer-reviewed studies published over the past 40 years, researchers from the University of South Carolina and the University of Paris-Sud found that variation in low-level, natural background radiation was found to have small, but highly statistically significant, negative effects on DNA as well as several measures of health. The review is a meta-analysis of studies of locations around the globe …. “Pooling across multiple studies, in multiple areas, and in a rigorous statistical manner provides a tool to really get at these questions about low-level radiation.” Mousseau and co-author Anders Møller of the University of Paris-Sud combed the scientific literature, examining more than 5,000 papers involving natural background radiation that were narrowed to 46 for quantitative comparison. The selected studies all examined both a control group and a more highly irradiated population and quantified the size of the radiation levels for each. Each paper also reported test statistics that allowed direct comparison between the studies. The organisms studied included plants and animals, but had a large preponderance of human subjects. Each study examined one or more possible effects of radiation, such as DNA damage measured in the lab, prevalence of a disease such as Down’s Syndrome, or the sex ratio produced in offspring. For each effect, a statistical algorithm was used to generate a single value, the effect size, which could be compared across all the studies. The scientists reported significant negative effects in a range of categories, including immunology, physiology, mutation and disease occurrence. The frequency of negative effects was beyond that of random chance. *** “When you do the meta-analysis, you do see significant negative effects.” “It also provides evidence that there is no threshold below which there are no effects of radiation,” he added. “A theory that has been batted around a lot over the last couple of decades is the idea that is there a threshold of exposure below which there are no negative consequences. These data provide fairly strong evidence that there is no threshold — radiation effects are measurable as far down as you can go, given the statistical power you have at hand.” Mousseau hopes their results, which are consistent with the “linear-no-threshold” model for radiation effects, will better inform the debate about exposure risks. “With the levels of contamination that we have seen as a result of nuclear power plants, especially in the past, and even as a result of Chernobyl and Fukushima and related accidents, there’s an attempt in the industry to downplay the doses that the populations are getting, because maybe it’s only one or two times beyond what is thought to be the natural background level,” he said. “But they’re assuming the natural background levels are fine.” “And the truth is, if we see effects at these low levels, then we have to be thinking differently about how we develop regulations for exposures, and especially intentional exposures to populations, like the emissions from nuclear power plants, medical procedures, and even some x-ray machines at airports.”

Physicians for Social Responsibility notes:

According to the National Academy of Sciences, there are no safe doses of radiation. Decades of research show clearly that any dose of radiation increases an individual’s risk for the development of cancer. “There is no safe level of radionuclide exposure, whether from food, water or other sources. Period,” said Jeff Patterson, DO, immediate past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility. “Exposure to radionuclides, such as iodine-131 and cesium-137, increases the incidence of cancer. For this reason, every effort must be taken to minimize the radionuclide content in food and water.” “Consuming food containing radionuclides is particularly dangerous. If an individual ingests or inhales a radioactive particle, it continues to irradiate the body as long as it remains radioactive and stays in the body,”said Alan H. Lockwood, MD, a member of the Board of Physicians for Social Responsibility. *** Radiation can be concentrated many times in the food chain and any consumption adds to the cumulative risk of cancer and other diseases.

John LaForge writes:

The National Council on Radiation Protection says, “… every increment of radiation exposure produces an incremen­tal increase in the risk of cancer.” The Environmental Protection Agency says, “… any exposure to radiation poses some risk, i.e. there is no level below which we can say an exposure poses no risk.” The Department of Energy says about “low levels of radiation” that “… the major effect is a very slight increase in cancer risk.” The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says, “any amount of radiation may pose some risk for causing cancer … any increase in dose, no matter how small, results in an incremental increase in risk.” The National Academy of Sciences, in its “Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII,” says, “… it is unlikely that a threshold exists for the induction of cancers ….”

Japan Times reports:

Protracted exposure to low-level radiation is associated with a significant increase in the risk of leukemia, according to a long-term study published Thursday in a U.S. research journal. The study released in the monthly Environmental Health Perspectives was based on a 20-year survey of around 110,000 workers who engaged in cleanup work related to the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in 1986. Scientists from the University of California, San Francisco, the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine in Ukraine were among those who participated in the research.

Indeed, the overwhelming consensus among radiation experts is that repeated exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancer, genetic mutations, heart disease, stroke and other serious illness (and see this.) If a government agency says anything else, it’s likely for political reasons.

The top U.S. government radiation experts – like Karl Morgan, John Goffman and Arthur Tamplin – and scientific luminaries such as Ernest Sternglass and Alice Stewart, concluded that low level radiation can cause serious health effects.

A military briefing written by the U.S. Army for commanders in Iraq states:

Hazards from low level radiation are long-term, not acute effects… Every exposure increases risk of cancer.

(Military briefings for commanders often contain less propaganda than literature aimed at civilians, as the commanders have to know the basic facts to be able to assess risk to their soldiers.)

The briefing states that doses are cumulative, citing the following military studies and reports:

ACE Directive 80-63, ACE Policy for Defensive Measures against Low Level Radiological Hazards during Military Operations, 2 AUG 96

AR 11-9, The Army Radiation Program, 28 MAY 99

FM 4-02.283, Treatment of Nuclear and Radiological Casualties, 20 DEC 01

NATO STANAG 2473, Command Guidance on Low Level Radiation Exposure in Military Operations, 3 MAY 00

USACHPPM TG 244, The NBC Battle Book, AUG 02

Many studies have shown that repeated exposures to low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans and x-rays can cause cancer. See this, this, this. this, this, this, this, this, this and this.

Research from the University of Iowa concluded:

Cumulative radon exposure is a significant risk factor for lung cancer in women.

And see these studies on the health effects cumulative doses of radioactive cesium.

As the European Committee on Radiation Risk notes:

Cumulative impacts of chronic irradiation in low doses are … important for the comprehension, assessment and prognosis of the late effects of irradiation on human beings ….

And see this.

The New York Times’ Matthew Wald reported last year:

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists[’] May-June issue carries seven articles and an editorial on the subject of low-dose radiation, a problem that has thus far defied scientific consensus but has assumed renewed importance since the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors in Japan in March 2011. *** This month a guest editor, Jan Beyea [who received a PhD in nuclear physics from Columbia and has served on a number of committees at the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science] and worked on epidemiological studies at Three Mile Island, takes a hard look at the power industry. The bulletin’s Web site is generally subscription-only, but this issue can be read at no charge. Dr. Beyea challenges a concept adopted by American safety regulators about small doses of radiation. The prevailing theory is that the relationship between dose and effect is linear – that is, that if a big dose is bad for you, half that dose is half that bad, and a quarter of that dose is one-quarter as bad, and a millionth of that dose is one-millionth as bad, with no level being harmless. The idea is known as the “linear no-threshold hypothesis,’’ and while most scientists say there is no way to measure its validity at the lower end, applying it constitutes a conservative approach to public safety. Some radiation professionals disagree, arguing that there is no reason to protect against supposed effects that cannot be measured. But Dr. Beyea contends that small doses could actually be disproportionately worse. Radiation experts have formed a consensus that if a given dose of radiation delivered over a short period poses a given hazard, that hazard will be smaller if the dose is spread out. To use an imprecise analogy, if swallowing an entire bottle of aspirin at one sitting could kill you, consuming it over a few days might merely make you sick. In radiation studies, this is called a dose rate effectiveness factor. Generally, a spread-out dose is judged to be half as harmful as a dose given all at once. *** Dr. Beyea, however, proposes that doses spread out over time might be more dangerous than doses given all at once. [Background] He suggests two reasons: first, some effects may result from genetic damage that manifests itself only after several generations of cells have been exposed, and, second, a “bystander effect,” in which a cell absorbs radiation and seems unhurt but communicates damage to a neighboring cell, which can lead to cancer. One problem in the radiation field is that little of the data on hand addresses the problem of protracted exposure. Most of the health data used to estimate the health effects of radiation exposure comes from survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings of 1945. That was mostly a one-time exposure. Scientists who say that this data leads to the underestimation of radiation risks cite another problem: it does not include some people who died from radiation exposure immediately after the bombings. The notion here is that the people studied in ensuing decades to learn about the dose effect may have been stronger and healthier, which could have played a role in their survival. Still, the idea that the bomb survivor data is biased, or that stretched-out doses are more dangerous than instant ones, is a minority position among radiation scientists.

Dr. Beyea writes:

Three recent epidemiologic studies suggest that the risk from protracted exposure is no lower, and in fact may be higher, than from single exposures. *** Conventional wisdom was upset in 2005, when an international study, which focused on a large population of exposed nuclear workers, presented results that shocked the radiation protection community—and foreshadowed a sequence of research results over the following years. *** It all started when epidemiologist Elaine Cardis and 46 colleagues surveyed some 400,000 nuclear workers from 15 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia—workers who had experienced chronic exposures, with doses measured on radiation badges (Cardis et al., 2005). *** This study revealed a higher incidence for protracted exposure than found in the atomic-bomb data, representing a dramatic contradiction to expectations based on expert opinion. *** A second major occupational study appeared a few years later, delivering another blow to the theory that protracted doses were not so bad. This 2009 report looked at 175,000 radiation workers in the United Kingdom …. After the UK update was published, scientists combined results from 12 post-2002 occupational studies, including the two mentioned above, concluding that protracted radiation was 20 percent more effective in increasing cancer rates than acute exposures (Jacob et al., 2009). The study’s authors saw this result as a challenge to the cancer-risk values currently assumed for occupational radiation exposures. That is, they wrote that the radiation risk values used for workers should be increased over the atomic-bomb-derived values, not lowered by a factor of two or more. *** In 2007, one study—the first of its size—looked at low-dose radiation risk in a large, chronically exposed civilian population; among the epidemiological community, this data set is known as the “Techa River cohort.” From 1949 to 1956 in the Soviet Union, while the Mayak weapons complex dumped some 76 million cubic meters of radioactive waste water into the river, approximately 30,000 of the off-site population—from some 40 villages along the river—were exposed to chronic releases of radiation; residual contamination on riverbanks still produced doses for years after 1956. *** Here was a study of citizens exposed to radiation much like that which would be experienced following a reactor accident. About 17,000 members of the cohort have been studied in an international effort (Krestinina et al., 2007), largely funded by the US Energy Department; and to many in the department, this study was meant to definitively prove that protracted exposures were low in risk. The results were unexpected. The slope of the LNT fit turned out to be higher than predicted by the atomic-bomb data, providing additional evidence that protracted exposure does not reduce risk. *** In a 2012 study on atomic-bomb survivor mortality data (Ozasa et al., 2012), low-dose analysis revealed unexpectedly strong evidence for the applicability of the supralinear theory. From 1950 to 2003, more than 80,000 people studied revealed high risks per unit dose in the low-dose range, from 0.01 to 0.1 Sv.

A major 2012 study of atomic bomb data by the official joint U.S.-Japanese government study of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors found that low dose radiation causes cancer and genetic damage:

Dr. Peter Karamoskos notes:

The most comprehensive study of nuclear workers by the IARC, involving 600,000 workers exposed to an average cumulative dose of 19mSv, showed a cancer risk consistent with that of the A-bomb survivors.

Children are much more vulnerable to radiation than adults. American physician Brian Moench writes:

The idea that a threshold exists or there is a safe level of radiation for human exposure began unraveling in the 1950s when research showed one pelvic x-ray in a pregnant woman could double the rate of childhood leukemia in an exposed baby. Furthermore, the risk was ten times higher if it occurred in the first three months of pregnancy than near the end. This became the stepping-stone to the understanding that the timing of exposure was even more critical than the dose. The earlier in embryonic development it occurred, the greater the risk. A new medical concept has emerged, increasingly supported by the latest research, called “fetal origins of disease,” that centers on the evidence that a multitude of chronic diseases, including cancer, often have their origins in the first few weeks after conception by environmental insults disturbing normal embryonic development. It is now established medical advice that pregnant women should avoid any exposure to x-rays, medicines or chemicals when not absolutely necessary, no matter how small the dose, especially in the first three months.

“Epigenetics” is a term integral to fetal origins of disease, referring to chemical attachments to genes that turn them on or off inappropriately and have impacts functionally similar to broken genetic bonds. Epigenetic changes can be caused by unimaginably small doses – parts per trillion – be it chemicals, air pollution, cigarette smoke or radiation. Furthermore, these epigenetic changes can occur within minutes after exposure and may be passed on to subsequent generations. The Endocrine Society, 14,000 researchers and medical specialists in more than 100 countries, warned that “even infinitesimally low levels of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, indeed, any level of exposure at all, may cause endocrine or reproductive abnormalities, particularly if exposure occurs during a critical developmental window. Surprisingly, low doses may even exert more potent effects than higher doses.” If hormone-mimicking chemicals at any level are not safe for a fetus, then the concept is likely to be equally true of the even more intensely toxic radioactive elements drifting over from Japan, some of which may also act as endocrine disruptors. Many epidemiologic studies show that extremely low doses of radiation increase the incidence of childhood cancers, low birth-weight babies, premature births, infant mortality, birth defects and even diminished intelligence. Just two abdominal x-rays delivered to a male can slightly increase the chance of his future children developing leukemia. By damaging proteins anywhere in a living cell, radiation can accelerate the aging process and diminish the function of any organ. Cells can repair themselves, but the rapidly growing cells in a fetus may divide before repair can occur, negating the body’s defense mechanism and replicating the damage. Comforting statements about the safety of low radiation are not even accurate for adults. Small increases in risk per individual have immense consequences in the aggregate. When low risk is accepted for billions of people, there will still be millions of victims. New research on risks of x-rays illustrate the point. Radiation from CT coronary scans is considered low, but, statistically, it causes cancer in one of every 270 40-year-old women who receive the scan. Twenty year olds will have double that rate. Annually, 29,000 cancers are caused by the 70 million CT scans done in the US. Common, low-dose dental x-rays more than double the rate of thyroid cancer. Those exposed to repeated dental x-rays have an even higher risk of thyroid cancer.

It’s not just humans: scientists have found that animals receiving low doses of radiation from Chernobyl are sick as well.

Most “Background Radiation” Didn’t Exist Before Nuclear Weapons Testing and Nuclear Reactors

Uninformed commenters (and some industry flacks) claim that we get a higher exposure from background radiation (when we fly, for example) or x-rays then we get from nuclear accidents.

In fact, there was exactly zero background radioactive cesium or iodine before above-ground nuclear testing and nuclear accidents started.

Wikipedia provides some details on the distribution of cesium-137 due to human activities:

Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Chernobyl disaster. *** Caesium-137 is unique in that it is totally anthropogenic. Unlike most other radioisotopes, caesium-137 is not produced from its non-radioactive isotope, but from uranium. It did not occur in nature before nuclear weapons testing began. By observing the characteristic gamma rays emitted by this isotope, it is possible to determine whether the contents of a given sealed container were made before or after the advent of atomic bomb explosions. This procedure has been used by researchers to check the authenticity of certain rare wines, most notably the purported “Jefferson bottles”.

As the EPA notes:

Cesium-133 is the only naturally occurring isotope and is non-radioactive; all other isotopes, including cesium-137, are produced by human activity.

Similarly, iodine-131 is not a naturally occurring isotope. As the Encyclopedia Britannica notes:

The only naturally occurring isotope of iodine is stable iodine-127. An exceptionally useful radioactive isotope is iodine-131…

(Fukushima has spewed much more radioactive cesium and iodine than Chernobyl. The amount of radioactive cesium released by Fukushima was some 20-30 times higher than initially admitted. Japanese experts say that Fukushima is currently releasing up to 93 billion becquerels of radioactive cesium into the ocean each day. And – as we will see below- the cesium levels hitting the west coast of North America will keep increasing for several years. Fukushima is spewing more and more radiation into the environment, and the amount of radioactive fuel at Fukushima dwarfs Chernobyl.)

As such, the concept of “background radiation” is largely a misnomer. Most of the radiation we encounter today – especially the most dangerous types – did not even exist in nature before we built nuclear weapons and reactors.

Nuclear Apologists Are Going Bananas

Nuclear apologists pretend that people are exposed to more radiation from bananas than from Fukushima.

But unlike low-levels of radioactive potassium found in bananas – which our bodies have adapted to over many years – cesium-137 and iodine 131 are brand new, extremely dangerous substances.

The EPA explains:

The human body is born with potassium-40 [the type of radiation found in bananas] in its tissues and it is the most common radionuclide in human tissues and in food. We evolved in the presence of potassium-40 and our bodies have well–developed repair mechanisms to respond to its effects. The concentration of potassium-40 in the human body is constant and not affected by concentrations in the environment.

Wikipedia notes:

The amount of potassium (and therefore of 40K) in the human body is fairly constant because of homeostatsis, so that any excess absorbed from food is quickly compensated by the elimination of an equal amount. It follows that the additional radiation exposure due to eating a banana lasts only for a few hours after ingestion, namely the time it takes for the normal potassium contents of the body to be restored by the kidneys.

BoingBoing reports:

A lot of things you might not suspect of being radioactive are, including Brazil nuts, and your own body. And this fact is sometimes used to downplay the impact of exposure to radiation via medical treatments or accidental intake. *** I contacted Geoff Meggitt—a retired health physicist, and former editor of the Journal of Radiological Protection—to find out more. Meggitt worked for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and its later commercial offshoots for 25 years. He says there’s an enormous variation in the risks associated with swallowing the same amount of different radioactive materials—and even some difference between the same dose, of the same material, but in different chemical forms. It all depends on two factors: 1) The physical characteristics of the radioactivity—i.e, What’s its half-life? Is the radiation emitted alpha, beta or gamma? 2) The way the the radioactivity travels around and is taken up by the body—i.e., How much is absorbed by the blood stream? What tissues does this specific isotope tend to accumulate in? The Potassium-40 in bananas is a particularly poor model isotope to use, Meggitt says, because the potassium content of our bodies seems to be under homeostatic control. When you eat a banana, your body’s level of Potassium-40 doesn’t increase. You just get rid of some excess Potassium-40. The net dose of a banana is zero. And that’s the difference between a useful educational tool and propaganda. (And I say this as somebody who is emphatically not against nuclear energy.) Bananas aren’t really going to give anyone “a more realistic assessment of actual risk”, they’re just going to further distort the picture.

Mixing Apples (External) and Oranges (Internal)

Moreover, radioactive particles which end up inside of our lungs or gastrointestinal track, as opposed to radiation which comes to us from outside of our skin are much more dangerous than general exposures to radiation.

The National Research Council’s Committee to Assess the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program explains:

Radioactivity generates radiation by emitting particles. Radioactive materials outside the the body are called external emitters, and radioactive materials located within the body are called internal emitters.

Internal emitters are much more dangerous than external emitters. Specifically, one is only exposed to radiation as long as he or she is near the external emitter.

For example, when you get an x-ray, an external emitter is turned on for an instant, and then switched back off.

But internal emitters steadily and continuously emit radiation for as long as the particle remains radioactive, or until the person dies – whichever occurs first. As such, they are much more dangerous.

As the head of a Tokyo-area medical clinic – Dr. Junro Fuse, Internist and head of Kosugi Medical Clinic – said:

Risk from internal exposure is 200-600 times greater than risk from external exposure.

See this, this, this and this.

By way of analogy, external emitters are like dodgeballs being thrown at you. If you get hit, it might hurt. But it’s unlikely you’ll get hit again in the same spot.

Internal emitters – on the other hand – are like a black belt martial artist moving in really close and hammering you again and again and again in the exact same spot. That can do real damage.

There are few natural high-dose internal emitters. Bananas, brazil nuts and some other foods contain radioactive potassium-40, but in extremely low doses. But – as explained above – our bodies have adapted to handle this type of radiation.

True, some parts of the country are at higher risk of exposure to naturally-occurring radium than others.

But the cesium which was scattered all over the place by above-ground nuclear tests and the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents has a much longer half life, and can easily contaminate food and water supplies. As the New York Times notes:

Over the long term, the big threat to human health is cesium-137, which has a half-life of 30 years. At that rate of disintegration, John Emsley wrote in “Nature’s Building Blocks” (Oxford, 2001), “it takes over 200 years to reduce it to 1 percent of its former level.” It is cesium-137 that still contaminates much of the land in Ukraine around the Chernobyl reactor. *** Cesium-137 mixes easily with water and is chemically similar to potassium. It thus mimics how potassium gets metabolized in the body and can enter through many foods, including milk.

As the EPA notes in a discussion entitled ” What can I do to protect myself and my family from cesium-137?”:

Cesium-137 that is dispersed in the environment, like that from atmospheric testing, is impossible to avoid.

Radioactive iodine can also become a potent internal emitter. As the Times notes:

Iodine-131 has a half-life of eight days and is quite dangerous to human health. If absorbed through contaminated food, especially milk and milk products, it will accumulate in the thyroid and cause cancer.

The bottom line is that there is some naturally-occurring background radiation, which can – at times – pose a health hazard (especially in parts of the country with high levels of radioactive radon or radium).

But cesium-137 and radioactive iodine – the two main radioactive substances being spewed by the leaking Japanese nuclear plants – are not naturally-occurring substances, and can become powerful internal emitters which can cause tremendous damage to the health of people who are unfortunate enough to breathe in even a particle of the substances, or ingest them in food or water.

Unlike low-levels of radioactive potassium found in bananas – which our bodies have adapted to over many years – cesium-137 and iodine 131 are brand new, extremely dangerous substances.

And unlike naturally-occurring internal emitters like radon and radium – whose distribution is largely concentrated in certain areas of the country – radioactive cesium and iodine, as well as strontium and other dangerous radionuclides, are being distributed globally through weapons testing and nuclear accidents.

Cumulative and Synergistic Damage

As noted above, a military briefing written by the U.S. Army for commanders in Iraq points out:

Hazards from low level radiation are long-term, not acute effects… Every exposure increases risk of cancer.

In other words, doses are cumulative: the more times someone is exposed, the greater the potential damage.

In addition, exposure to different radioactive particles may increase the damage. Specifically, the International Commission on Radiological Protection notes:

It has been shown that in some cases a synergistic effect results when several organs of the body are irradiated simultaneously.

(“Synergistic” means that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.)

Because different radionuclides accumulate in different parts of the body – e.g. cesium in the muscles, kidneys, heart and liver, iodine in the thyroid, and strontium in the bones – the exposure to many types of radiation may be more dangerous than exposure just to one or two types.

As such, adding new radioactive compounds like cesium and iodine into the environment may cause synergistic damage to our health.

II. How Much Radiation Will We Be Exposed To?

There are 2 ways that Fukushima radiation has traveled from Fukushima to Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, Washington, Oregon and California: (1) by air; and (2) by water.

By Air

We noted 2 days after the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami:

Pollution from Chinese coal factories routinely hits California. For example, Mongabay noted in 2008: Previous studies have documented that dust from Asia — especially from deserts and industrial regions of China — routinely crosses the Pacific Ocean on prevailing winds to sully the air over the western U.S. And see this and this. As the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory wrote last December: About a third of the airborne lead particles recently collected at two sites in the San Francisco Bay Area came from Asia, a finding that underscores the far-flung impacts of air pollution and heralds a new way to learn more about its journey across vast distances.In a first-of-its-kind study, scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the California Air Resources Board tracked variations in the amount of lead transported across the Pacific over time. *** It’s well known that particles and other aerosols cover long distances through the Earth’s atmosphere. But the details of this transport, such as that of the lead particles’ 7,000-mile journey from the smokestacks of China to the west coast of North America, are largely unknown. In fact, the jet stream passes right over Japan. The jet stream was noticed in the 1920′s by a Japanese meteorologist near Mount Fuji, and the Japanese launched balloon bombs into the jetstream to attack America during WWII. If radioactivity got blown by surface winds up into the jet stream, it could spread widely.

Health Canada (the department of the government of Canada with responsibility for national public health) notes that – while people may naively assume that radioactive plumes are weakened and diffused before they hit the West Coast – there can be “sharp features” with higher concentrations hitting North America in certain areas.

This has happened, to some extent. For example, radiation from Fukushima was directly deposited into the kelp off the Western coast of North America … especially in Southern California. Fish that eat the kelp have also gotten exposed to the radiation … as have the animals that eat those fish. Moreover, Seattle residents may have been exposed to some Fukushima radiation soon after the accident.

Plutonium was also released into the air. For example, the Environmental Research Department, SRI Center for Physical Sciences and Technology in Vilnius, Lithuania reported in the Journal of Environmental Radioactivity:

Analyses of (131)I, (137)Cs and (134)Cs in airborne aerosols were carried out in daily samples in Vilnius, Lithuania after the Fukushima accident during the period of March-April, 2011. *** The activity ratio of (238)Pu/(239,240)Pu in the aerosol sample was 1.2, indicating a presence of the spent fuel of different origin than that of the Chernobyl accident.

(“Pu” is short for plutonium.) Fukushima is 4,988 miles from Vilnius, Lithuania. So the plutonium traveled quite a distance.

Tepco – the operator of the Fukushima plants – has been pouring tons of water on the reactors every day. So this is helping to keep the aerial releases down.

However, the Japanese government has embarked on a massive program of burning radioactive waste throughout Japan. This is idiotic … and is releasing some radiation into the air.

In any event, unless the Fukushima fuel pools collapse – or the government increases the amount of radioactive materials which it burns – the air will not be the main route for the spread of radiation to Hawaii or the West Coast.

By Water

The jet stream can carry radiation through the air from Japan to the West Coast, as noted above. A similar dynamic is present in the water, as well.

An ocean current called the North Pacific Gyre is bringing Japanese radiation to the West Coast of North America:

The leg of the Gyre closest to Japan – the Kuroshio current – begins right next to Fukushima:

While many people assume that the ocean will dilute the Fukushima radiation, a previously-secret 1955 U.S. government report concluded that the ocean may not adequately dilute radiation from nuclear accidents, and there could be “pockets” and “streams” of highly-concentrated radiation.

Nuclear expert Robert Alvarez – senior policy adviser to the Energy Department’s secretary and deputy assistant secretary for national security and the environment from 1993 to 1999 – wrote:

According to a previously secret 1955 memo from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission regarding concerns of the British government over contaminated tuna, “dissipation of radioactive fall-out in ocean waters is not a gradual spreading out of the activity from the region with the highest concentration to uncontaminated regions, but that in all probability the process results in scattered pockets and streams of higher radioactive materials in the Pacific. We can speculate that tuna which now show radioactivity from ingested materials [this is in 1955, not today] have been living, in or have passed through, such pockets; or have been feeding on plant and animal life which has been exposed in those areas.”

The New York Times reported in 2011:

F. Ward Whicker, a professor emeritus at Colorado State University who developed a leading model for following radiation through the food chain …. said. “There can be hot spots far away from an accident, and places in between that are fine.”

The Congressional Research Service noted last year:

There remains the slight potential for a relatively narrow corridor of highly contaminated water leading away from Japan … *** Transport by ocean currents is much slower, and additional radiation from this source might eventually also be detected in North Pacific waters under U.S. jurisdiction, even months after its release. Regardless of slow ocean transport, the long half-life of radioactive cesium isotopes means that radioactive contaminants could remain a valid concern for years.

Physicians for Social Responsibility notes:

An interesting fact for people living on the US west coast is also included in the UNSCEAR [United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation] report: only about 5% of the directly discharged radiation was deposited within a radius of 80 km from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station. The rest was distributed in the Pacific Ocean. 3-D simulations have been carried out for the Pacific basin, showing that within 5–6 years, the emissions would reach the North American coastline, with uncertain consequences for food safety and health of the local population.

Below, we will tell you that some radiation has already reached the West Coast … and we will show you some future projections for radiation.

But it is important to keep in mind that – while Fukushima has been leaking massive amounts of water continuously ever since March 2011 – most of the projections being used in models of radiation do not include any releases after March 2011. As radioecologist Doug Dasher told Fox News:

“The estimates [of radiation] vary substantially and do not, at least so far, account for the continued leakage from the Fukushima site to the marine environment,” he said.

As such, all of the models drastically underestimate the amount of radiation which West Coast and Hawaiian residents will be exposed to.

Radiation Predictions

The University of Hawaii’s International Pacific Research Center created a graphic showing the projected dispersion of debris from Japan:

A joint research project between the Chinese and South Korean governments shows the West Coast receiving Fukushima radiation.

Last year, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and 3 scientists from the GEOMAR Research Center for Marine Geosciences showed that radiation on the West Coast of North America could end up being 10 times higher than in Japan:

After 10 years the concentrations become nearly homogeneous over the whole Pacific, with higher values in the east, extending along the North American coast with a maximum (~1 × 10−4) off Baja California. *** With caution given to the various idealizations (unknown actual oceanic state during release, unknown release area, no biological effects included, see section 3.4), the following conclusions may be drawn. (i) Dilution due to swift horizontal and vertical dispersion in the vicinity of the energetic Kuroshio regime leads to a rapid decrease of radioactivity levels during the first 2 years, with a decline of near-surface peak concentrations to values around 10 Bq m−3 (based on a total input of 10 PBq). The strong lateral dispersion, related to the vigorous eddy fields in the mid-latitude western Pacific, appears significantly under-estimated in the non-eddying (0.5°) model version. (ii) The subsequent pace of dilution is strongly reduced, owing to the eastward advection of the main tracer cloud towards the much less energetic areas of the central and eastern North Pacific. (iii) The magnitude of additional peak radioactivity should drop to values comparable to the pre-Fukushima levels after 6–9 years (i.e. total peak concentrations would then have declined below twice pre-Fukushima levels). (iv) By then the tracer cloud will span almost the entire North Pacific, with peak concentrations off the North American coast an order-of-magnitude higher than in the western Pacific. ***

(“Order-of-magnitude” is a scientific term which means 10 times higher. The “Western Pacific” means Japan’s East Coast.)

In May, a team of scientists from Spain, Australia and France concluded that the radioactive cesium would look more like this:

A team of top Chinese scientists published a study earlier this year in the Science China Earth Sciences journal showing that the radioactive plume crosses the ocean in a nearly straight line toward North America, and that it appears to stay together with little dispersion:

On March 30, 2011, the Japan Central News Agency reported the monitored radioactive pollutions that were 4000 times higher than the standard level. Whether or not these nuclear pollutants will be transported to the Pacific-neighboring countries through oceanic circulations becomes a world-wide concern. *** The time scale of the nuclear pollutants reaching the west coast of America is 3.2 years if it is estimated using the surface drifting buoys and 3.9 years if it is estimated using the nuclear pollutant particulate tracers. ***

The half life of cesium-137 is so long that it produces more damage to human. Figure 4 gives the examples of the distribution of the impact strength of Cesium-137 at year 1.5 (panel (a)), year 3.5 (panel (b)), and year 4 (panel (c)). *** It is worth noting that due to the current near the shore cannot be well reconstructed by the global ocean reanalysis, some nuclear pollutant particulate tracers may come to rest in near shore area, which may result in additional uncertainty in the estimation of the impact strength. *** Since the major transport mechanism of nuclear pollutants for the west coast of America is the Kuroshio-extension currents, after four years, the impact strength of Cesium-137 in the west coast area of America is as high as 4%.

In addition to Cesium, Fukushima has pumped out an enormous amount of Iodine 129 into the ocean: approximately 8 billion becquerels. Iodine 129 has a half-life of 15.7 million years.

It has also released a lot of strontium 90. In the first 3 months alone after the earthquake and tsunami, Fukushima dumped between 90 and 900 trillion becquerels of strontium 90.

Tepco Is Planning On Dumping All of the Radiation Into the Ocean

The accidental radiation releases have been enomrous. But Tepco is apparently planning on dumping all of the radioactive water stored at Fukushima into the ocean.

Some Radiation Has Already Reached the West Coast

Some radiation has already arrived on the West Coast by ocean. For example, CBC reported earlier this month:

Scientists at the University of Alaska are concerned about radiation leaking from Japan’s damaged Fukushima nuclear plant, and the lack of a monitoring plan. Some radiation has arrived in northern Alaska and along the west coast. That’s raised concern over contamination of fish and wildlife. *** John Kelley, a professor emeritus at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, says he’s not sure contamination will reach dangerous levels for humans but says without better data, who will know? “The data they will need is not only past data but current data, and if no one is sampling anything then we won’t really know it, will we? “The general concern was, is the food supply safe? And I don’t think anyone can really answer that definitively.”

An associate professor and marine chemist at University of Victoria’s School of Earth and Ocean Sciences told CBC on November 20th (8:15):

The Department of Fisheries and Oceans — the Institute of Ocean Science … program which is a time series program that monitors the chemistry and biology of the North Pacific that’s headed up by Maria Robert. They’re making measurements of these Fukushima-source radionuclides offshore, and they’re starting to detect the presence of the plume of radioactivity.

(Incidentally – because rain is one of the main ways that radiation can spread – seawater which evaporates and then rains on the coast can dump radiation inland for some distance).

Seafood

A former high-level U.S. government nuclear expert – and now one of the main advisors to Tepco regarding Fukushima – says that Fukushima radiation will hit Alaska fish. Lake Barrett – the former head of the US Department of Energy’s Office of Civilian Nuclear Waste Management, which is responsible for implementing the United States’ programs for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, and a high-level official with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission before that – told an MIT audience (36:00):

The environmental release is the growing challenge; you’re going to read more and more about it in the paper. Wait until the first cesium-137 shows up in Alaska salmon, which is only a matter of time. You’re going to find it right back in the headlines.

Bluefin tuna on the California shore have already tested positive for radiation from Fukushima, and there are reports of highly radioactive fish in Canada.

III. How Can We Protect Ourselves from Radiation?

The government isn’t adequately testing radiation levels in the ocean, seafood or air.

So it is vital that we contact our government representatives and demand that they thoroughly test for radiation … and publicly release the information.

In addition, there are easy, inexpensive and healthy steps we can take right now to help protect ourselves against radiation.

Mr. President in this historical moment you carry the heavy burden of deciding the life and death issues for people who have been ravaged too long by a health care system that says the profit in a dollar is more valuable than the natural unalienable right to health care. I could state the overwhelming statistics which you already are aware of but doing this will not bring back the countless faces no longer with us or plunged into economic despair over a failed system.

""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""

It continued with the fight for public education and libraries fundamental to a free society healthy in mind and spirit. It continued with the abolition of slavery. It continued with the enactment of child labor law and the right to unionize. It continued with the enactment of social security. It continued with the enactment of civil rights and medicare.



The one universal truth of all these battles is that countless individuals bled and lost their lives to secure these rights. There was always a large vocal minority opposition predicting the end of our civilization as we know it organized primarily by the corporatist who have and never will concede power and influence without extracting our blood and treasury.

I am not in Washington but I am here to fight for my rights and the rights of others. We have bled too long once again not to see this fight through. Let a cry go out across this great country ALL HANDS ON DECK TO SECURE OUR FUTURE!

Ireland’s crisis is that of insolvency, not of a liquidity squeeze 9although it is increasingly looking like the latter will come in the end). If EFSF were to be explicitly used to address Ireland crisis, then Irish Government will be de facto borrowing from the fund with no hope of repaying it ever back (recall – the lending rates under EFSF should be set close to the market rates, which means, say 7-8% currently, which in turn automatically means we can’t be expected to repay this). If so, then any borrower, I repeat – any borrower – from EFSF will not repay the funds borrowed. And this means EFSF borrowings will have to be covered collectively out of the joint funds of the entire Eurozone. You can pretty much count PIIGS out of funding it – they’ll be the very same borrowers. Which leaves it to France and Germany (Belgium hardly can pay much and Austria has it’s own problems etc) to cover the entire fund.

EFSF own structure implies high risk of contagion from Ireland.







It delays the inevitable restructuring of the massive debts accumulated on the Irish economy side – either sovereign or banks or households or any two or all three. EFSF does not remove the need for such a restructuring. It simply delays it. It signifies an exponential increase in the probability of EFSF acting as a conduit for contagion from the PIIGS to the rest of the Euro area.



let me ask the following question: if Ireland is nearing (or already in - see here ) a bailout from the EFSF, what does this imply to the overall Euro area stability? Funny thing - it turns out that a little old Ireland can give a big young Euro quite a headache because of the way EFSF is structured.Let’s step back and take a look at the promise EFSF attempts to deliver.The fund, set up back in May this year, was supposed to provide an emergency funding backstop to countries finding themselves in a liquidity squeeze (unable to borrow in the markets).There two basic problems with this idea from the point of view contagion from IrelandThat second point is slightly technical and requires some explaining to do.One can make an argument that Ireland, if it borrows from EFSF, will trigger an increase in the Euro zone systemic risk. EFSF is set up similar to Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) with a ""credit enhancement"" that allows the senior debt tranche to retain higher risk rating because junior tranches are the ones that will carry the first hit on the whole package in the case of default.The lags in the disbursement of funding and the capped nature, plus ‘enhancement’ bit of the CDO implies that countries in trouble will have to get into the funding stream as early as possible – as there is quick exhaustion of drawdown funds in the EFSF due to the knock on effect on CDO rating. This is known as an accelerated negative feedback mechanism – as sovereign comes under pressure, sovereigns are encouraged to race into EFSF, which removes their own bonds and capacity to carry debt out of the senior CDO tranche and increases their presence in the junior tranches.So the guaranteed pool of liabilities increases by the amount country borrows from the fund, but the senior pool decreases by the contribution of this country to the fund. This means that as Ireland joint EFSF, it’s past ‘good credit’ rating falls to zero in the senior CDO tranche, its ‘bad debt’ risk contributes to the reduced quality of the liabilities held by the EFSF. Pressure rises on AAA rating of EFSF, unless EFSF draws more of AAA-rated countries debt into its senior tranche to offset this. EFSF will have to expand to be able to do both: lend out to Ireland and maintain AAA rating. Which, of course means that other EFSF contributors will need to issue more debt to recapitalize EFSF. Which means their own AAA ratings are becoming threatened as well.You see where it all leads, now, don’t you?The greater is the number of countries seeking help and/or the greater is the overall demand for EFSF funds, the greater the required buffer funding increases from the remaining EFSF-lending AAA-rated sovereigns. All of which, in plain English means that the EFSF will run into its own lending limits quicker if Ireland were to go into borrowing from it. Much quicker than a simple level of our borrowing would suggest.Now, any sovereign with an once of sense now will know that a race to tap EFSF is on. The faster you get to it to borrow from it, the more likely you’ll arrive to the borrowing window before the limits are reached. Portugal, Spain and possibly even Italy are in the race.This is why the markets have never been easy about the entire EFSF – they know that Ireland tapping into EFSF simply does two things:",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Irish crisis, Irish Government deficit, Ireland rescue, Irish Government bonds, European Financial Stability Facility, Euro area rescue, Irish debt, Euro area contagion",,

This presentation from IDA contains the following chart:







Now, IDA is correct in highlighting the Current Account as a key to our recovery 'policies'. For a number of reasons:

In virtually all debt overhang recessions in the past, return to positive surpluses on current account were required as a necessary, albeit not always sufficient, condition to restore economy to a stable path In Ireland, we have witnessed some significant improvements in the Current Account so far during the Great Recession Alas, the above chart is a mystery to me. Let me explain.

Firstly, it cites CSO as the source of the chart. I have contacted CSO about their 'forecasts' for 2012-2017 period for the Current Account and their reply was: "" Having consulted with my colleagues they assure me that they do not produce forecasts, let alone five year forecasts. Furthermore, my colleague suggested that the figures might be derived from a paper published by the Dept. of Finance (page 9): http://budget.gov.ie/budgets/ 2012/Documents/Economic%20and% 20Fiscal%20Outlook.pdf It should be stressed, however, that these figures are the department's and not the CSO 's.""



Now, here are two forecasts for Ireland's Current Account known to me, sourced from the updated IMF database (July 2012 update to WEO database) and the above link from the Department of Finance:









Clearly, no source, bar IMF projects anything beyond 2015. Also, clearly, even the IMF projections appear (one can't really properly read IDA chart) to be as 'upbeat' as IDA's chart in 2013-2017 projections range.





But wait, recall that IMF is providing a forecast, based on their central tendency scenario. They also provide useful assumptions and data that went into their scenarios assessments which allow us to compute historical confidence intervals for their own forecast. And, ahem, it turns out the IMF 'central' tendency forecast - illustrated above - firmly falls outside the reasonable 90% single tail confidence interval (adjusting for sample size, but caveating this). In other words, it is improbable, were historical Irish performance on current account balance to be out guide. The same applies to the stress-testing metric on current accounts used by the IMF - the primary current account balances (current account ex-interest payments).





So the IMF forecasts above assume massive change in Irish current account performance relative to history, the change that - may be IDA can expand on this - is supposed to come in the environment of adverse global trading conditions, pharma cliff hitting Irish exports, and re-orientation of trade flows worldwide away from North-South shipments of higher value added goods and services toward South-South flows.





But wait, things are actually worse than that. DofF forecasts deviate from the average for the above sources ex-DofF by a cumulative 1.7% of GDP and from those by the IMF by a cumulative of 2.5% of GDP for the period 2011-2015, which means that DofF forecasts are even less probabilistically likely to materialise than those for the IMF.





Even were the IMF to materialise, Ireland's current account surplus in 2012-2017 will be 2.78% of GDP on average - an impressive swing from a recent historical performance, yet contrasted by the economy with ca 120% debt/GDP metric on Government side alone! Anyone out there really thinking this is going to be a silver bullet for our economy?

So things are a bit less rosy than the IDA seems willing to admit to the prospective Foreign Direct Investors and the media.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Irish economic policy, Irish GDP, IDA, Current Account, Irish growth, Irish value added, Irish current account, Irish trade surplus, Irish GNP, Irish balance of payments",,

It could have been a rogue, low-level military officer.

Foreign Policy reports:

With the United States barreling toward a strike on Syria, U.S. officials say they are completely certain that Bashar al-Assad’s government is responsible for last week’s chemical weapons attack. They just don’t know who in the Syrian government is to blame.

On Wednesday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf admitted as much. “The commander-in-chief of any military is ultimately responsible for decisions made under their leadership, even if … he’s not the one that pushes the button or said, ‘Go,’ on this,” Harf said. “I don’t know what the facts are here ….”

On Tuesday, The Cable reported that U.S. officials are basing their assessment that the Assad regime bears responsibility for the strike largely on an intercepted phone call between a panicked Ministry of Defense official and a commander of a Syrian chemical weapons unit. But that intelligence does not resolve the question of who in the government ordered the strike ….

***

Because of that lack of clarity, Harf took a beating on Wednesday. In a testy exchange during her daily briefing, Harf very nearly admitted that it makes no difference who in the Syrian government ordered the attack, a reflection of the lack of certainty that still shrouds U.S. understanding of the chemical attack that may have left as many as 1,000 people dead.



In effect, Harf was left arguing that because no one else could have carried out the attack, it must have been the Syrian government. “The world doesn’t need a classified U.S. intelligence assessment to see the photos and the videos of these people and to know that the only possible entity in Syria that could do this to their own people is the regime,” she said.

Given that U.N. inspectors with a mandate to investigate chemical weapons use were on the ground when the attack happened, the decision to deploy what appears to have been a nerve agent in a suburb east of Damascus has puzzled many observers. Why would Syria do such a thing when it is fully aware that the mass use of chemical weapons is the one thing that might require the United States to take military action against it? That’s a question U.S. intelligence analysts are puzzling over as well. “We don’t know exactly why it happened,” the intelligence official said. “We just know it was pretty fucking stupid.”

Pressed on whether the United States would still consider itself justified in launching a punitive strike if the chemical weapons were deployed by a “rogue officer,” Harf said, “yes,” before quickly adding a caveat: “But that’s also a wildly conjecturous question.”",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,U.S. Admits It Has No Idea WHO Carried Out Syrian Chemical Weapons Attack,"Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد, Allain Jules",,[''],,,,

As stupid as Sarah Palin is, I highly doubt she is stupid enough to have an affair, much less divorce her husband. I know people are going on about ""Well she didn't have her wedding ring on during he 'farewell' address!"". So what? So she didn't have it on. Doesn't mean anything. Do you really think she wants to be lumped in there with the C-street loons, Ensign, and Sanford among others in this political climate when Republicans are being outed as hypocrites? But seriously, lets examine this closely and take a walk with me down Rational Lane and meet up on the corner of Sane Blvd.

Sarah Palin, while not a book smart person, or the wise to the ways of the world in terms of politics, does know the way of the world in terms of MONEY. And when it comes to her making money, she is a very shrewd person. She would not put that in trouble no matter what.

A Sarah Palin affair would have horrible ramifications on her personal character, and leave her open to an insane amount of criticism in her personal life. Unlike her political career, where she can quit and run and hide, and wait til the heat dies down. She would NEVER live this down. This would be on her til the day she died. Everytime her name was spoken in the media, it would always be brought up. It would make her and her family and the republican party to be the ultimate of ultimate hypocrites after painting her family as the All-American as apple pie, pure in family values family. Whatever she did in the future, it would never be left behind, which brings us to...

If Sarah Palin had an affair and was getting a divorce, it would just ruin any potential money making opportunities she would have as a private citizen. That book deal? Gone. Her gaining her own syndicated radio show? Gone. Her getting her own TV show on a mainstream media network outlet? Oh Hell no. Fox News wouldn't even touch her with a 50 foot stick. Speaking engagements? Most certainly no. Nobody would pay to hear a cheater, and a quitter speak about staying the course and family values.

Don't you think whoever had an affair with Sarah and Todd would be singing it from the mountain top? This would be their chance to cash in as any number of news networks would want that story. Trust me, if this were true, the story would have broken the second the affair was over.

So that sums it up for me. I never thought I'd be defending Sarah Palin, but come on you've gotta admit.

Black was the senior regulator during the S&L crisis, and an Associate Professor of Economics and Law at the University of Missouri (bio).

Black says that massive fraud is what caused the economic crisis. As one example, he explains that everyone involved knew that the CDOs which packaged subprime loans were not AAA credit-worthy (which means that they are completely risk-free). He also said that the exotic instruments (CDOs, CDS, etc.) which spun the mortgages into more and more abstract investments were intentionally created to defraud investors.

Moreover, Black says that the government’s entire strategy in dealing with the economic crisis is a massive cover-up:

[They] don’t want to change the bankers, because if we do, if we put honest people in, who didn’t cause the problem, their first job would be to find the scope of the problem. And that would destroy the cover up…. Geithner is … covering up. Just like Paulson did before him…. These are all people who have failed. Paulson failed, Geithner failed. They were all promoted because they failed…. Until you get the facts, it’s harder to blow all this up. And, of course, the entire strategy is to keep people from getting the facts…. [Question] Are you saying that Timothy Geithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, and others in the administration, with the banks, are engaged in a cover up to keep us from knowing what went wrong? [Black] Absolutely…. They’re deliberately leaving in place the people that caused the problem, because they don’t want the facts. And this is not new. The Reagan Administration’s central priority, at all times, during the Savings and Loan crisis, was covering up the losses. [Question] So, you’re saying that people in power, political power, and financial power, act in concert when their own behinds are in the ringer, right? That’s right. And it’s particularly a crisis that brings this out, because then the class of the banker says, “You’ve got to keep the information away from the public or everything will collapse.”

We are looking for somewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 PSI inside the capping stack, which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the wellbores are being able to withstand that pressure. And that is good news. If we are down around in the 4,000 to 5,000, 6,000 range that could potentially tell us that the hydrocarbons are being diverted someplace else, and we would have to try and assess the implications of that. And as you might imagine, there are gradations as you go up from 4,000 or 5,000 PSI up to 8,000 or 9,000. … We will at some point try to get to 8,000 or 9,000 and sustain that for some period of time, and these will be done basically, as I said — if we have a very low pressure reading, we will try and need (ph) at least six hours of those readings to try to ensure that that is the reading. If it’s a little higher, we want to go for 24 hours. And if it’s up at 8,000 or 9,000, we would like to go 48 hours just to make sure it can sustain those pressures for that amount of time.

The former director of Sandia National Laboratories says the pressure readings so far have been ambiguous.

The initial pressure readings are in an ambiguous range, and officials will have to make a difficult judgment call on whether to keep the well shut in or reopen it, according to Tom Hunter, retired director of the Sandia National Laboratories and a member of the federal government’s scientific team overseeing the test. “If it were a lot higher, it would be an easier decision to make,” Hunter said. *** Hunter, who witnessed the test from BP’s war room in Houston, told The Washington Post that the pressure rose to about 6,700 psi and appeared likely to level out “closer to 7,000.” He said one possibility is that the reservoir has lost pressure as it has depleted itself the past three months. “It’s just premature to tell. We just don’t know whether something is leaking or not,” Hunter said.

We will need to wait another 24 hours or so – and engineers will have to continue monitoring sonar and visual images (both help determine if any oil is leaking from the seafloor), and seismic data (to determine if there are any new leaks below the seafloor) – before engineers can determine how stable the well is.

Update: This was confirmed by BP’s Kent Wells in his July 16th morning press conference.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Initial Results from Well Integrity Test Are Inconclusive,"Posted On, Chris Williams",,[''],,,,

What I fear the most is a false flag – something happening where one of our ships goes down, or there’s a plane that goes down, and of course it HAD to be the Iranians, you know, for sure, for certain.

(Paul previously warned of a “Gulf of Tonkin type incident” in Iran.)

Paul joins numerous other high-level government officials who have warned that a false flag may be launched against Iran to start a war:



It would be far more preferable if the United States could cite an Iranian provocation as justification for the airstrikes before launching them. Clearly, the more outrageous, the more deadly, and the more unprovoked the Iranian action, the better off the United States would be.Of course, it would be very difficult for the United States to goad Iran into such a provocation without the rest of the world recognizing this game, which would then undermine it. (One method that would have some possibility of success would be to ratchet up covert regime change efforts in the hope that Tehran would retaliate overtly, or even semi-overtly, which could then be portrayed as an unprovoked act of Iranian aggression.)

Many critics have argued that there is a concerted effort to push the United States into a war with Iran by supporters of Israel. Patrick Clawson, director of research for the highly influential pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) think tank, seemed intent to prove those rumors true this week in comments as a luncheon on “How to Build US-Israeli Coordination on Preventing an Iranian Nuclear Breakout.” Clawson casually discusses how to create a false flag operation to push the U.S. into war to overcome any reluctance by the public. We have been discussing how many leaders like Senator Joe Lieberman had begun to use the same rhetoric that led to the last two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and how the suggest timing of an attack has been tied to the presidential election.

In his remarks, Clawson helpfully lists a series of historical events used to push the country into war like the Gulf of Tonkin incident that gave us the Vietnam War. Clawson expressed his frustration in acknowledging that it is “[v]ery hard for me to see how the United States President can get us to war with Iran.” However, there is hope. Clawson explains that the “traditional way” to get the country into a war is through false flags or manufactured incidents where Americans are killed. Thus, he observes, “we are in the game of using covert means against the Iranians, we could get nastier about it. So, if in fact the Iranians aren’t going to compromise, it would be best if somebody else started the war.”

The fact that one of the leading analysis for the WINEP would feel comfortable in making such comments is itself quite chilling. It indicates that such discussions have become sufficiently regular that it has creeped into public discussion. It is a measure of the secret pressure building to push this country into a third major war despite our crippling economic conditions and losses in military personnel. The assumption in Washington is that neither Romney nor Obama could oppose such a war. Even if Obama does not publicly support Israel, the assumption is that political allies of Israel in Washington can guarantee that we would offer extensive military loans and intelligence. Even if there is a delay in such military loans and support, the assumption is that Israel can go to war with the understanding that the United States will cover a significant portion of the costs. Moreover, in his remarkably candid remarks, Clawson shows how the U.S. can easily be forced into direct combat by pushing Iran to simply kill some Americans or sink a few of our ships. Then members would be clamoring for revenge. Notably, the Israelis have been ratcheting up the war rhetoric in pushing Iran, which predictably has now reserved the right to engage in a preemptive strike not just against Israeli but U.S. interests. We would then, again, find ourselves in a war without any public debate or collective decision.

While Clawson adds a passing caveat that he is not advocating such an approach, his remarks are clearly designed to show how the group can get the United States into a war for Israel if only we can get Iran to kill some of our citizens or soldiers. Those people are of course expendable props in Clawson’s realpolitik.

By the way, Clawson has been enlisted to give his insightful analysis at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He is also a member of the National Defense University’s Institute for National Strategic Studies. The World Bank connection is particularly interesting given the history with Paul Wolfowitz who pushed the U.S. into two disastrous wars in the Bush Administration and was rewarded with being made the head of the World Bank.

It is the callous disconnect that is most chilling in these remarks. Thousands of U.S. soldiers have died or have been crippled for life in these wars that have left the country near bankruptcy (and increasingly hostile “allies” in Afghanistan and Iraq). Those casualties and costs, however, appear immaterial in the discussion of supporting Israel in a war against Iran.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"Something Happening Where One of Our Ships Goes Down, Or ... a Plane Goes Down, And of Course It HAD To Be The Iranians, You Know, For Sure, For Certain""","Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد, B Jackson, Nish Mahan, Jay R., Russell Lawrence Benford, James Smith",,[''],,,,

The core issue the chart above raises is that simplified worldview of gold (or any other asset class) as a pure 'absolute return' play. Instead, every asset should be considered in the context of total portfolio of assets being held, including risk-adjusted returns the asset offers and hedging and safe haven properties it affords.

Here's a chart from @freegolds on oil-gold price co-movements:The point is - as raised here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521912001226Main points of our research:For the: ""… our results discussed above indicate that themarket does not in general act as a safe haven for stocks. However, we find that oil in fact acts as a safe haven during specific periods, such as around 1990, which is presumably related to the first Gulf War and recently, after the 2007-2009 financial crisis (the “credit crunch”). Moreover, the role of oil following the most recent crisis seems to be continuing. Similarly, oil acted as a safe haven for bonds after the 1987 stock market crash and also, after 2000, which is presumably related to the crash in technology and telecommunications stock on the NASDAQ. These results seem to create a pattern for the role of oil that has not been reported before.""""… we find specific periods in whichmarket acts as a safe haven. In particular, for equities, we detect evidence for this after 1990, again presumably related to the war, and also, for the recent credit crunch. The role of gold as the anti-dollar is further confirmed in this analysis, also. Gold can be considered a safe haven for dollar in most of the last decade.""For the: ""Our main finding perhaps is that we continue to observe a significant role for themarket as a safe haven when short time periods are targeted in our rolling regression analysis… In particular, oil acts as a safe haven for the UK stocks around 2001-2002, which coincide with the technology stocks collapse, and as well as around 2007- 2008, which coincide with another crash in stock values during the “credit crunch”. Moreover, oil is a safe haven for the UK bonds also around 2001-2002 period.""""On the other hand,cannot be considered a safe haven for the UK stocks during these equity markets turmoil periods, which should be of interest to market participants.""""Gold, however, continues to play its role as a safe haven against paper currencies with regards to the Sterling, also. Hence, our findings indicate that the attributes of gold in this regards are not confined to the US dollar. We find that gold is a safe haven for Sterling around 1998, which was a period of turmoil in financial markets due to the collapse of the hedge fund LTMC; around, 2001, again a period of turmoil due to collapse in technology stocks as mentioned above; and further around 2007-2008, which is of course the recent global financial crisis.""",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Safe havens, Gold, gold and oil, hedges and safe havens, Oil, Quantile regressions",,

I'm sure for those readers who are located in the deep south and mid-western United States, this would be a breeze to do. If there's anything gun nuts love to do, is talk about how they'd overthrow the government, and which guns would be right for the job. Some may even go into great detail about a plan already in the works and may even invite you to join in! Then, if we can somehow send it to some liberal media...[Keith Olbermann or Rachael Maddow would be pefect for this!], and get them to spin it in such a way that the NRA is linked to secretly overthrowing the government and actually a parent group to various domestic terrorist militias, we can get not only the defund the NRA talks going, but the DOJ to launch a serious investigation!

All kidding aside though, what I really plan to do, is write my senators[Mark Warner and Jim Webb], to ask to testify regarding this unconstitutional bill that is being proposed to defund Acorn. What this bill is specifically doing, is targeting Acorn on the basis of fraud to deny them any future funding and/or government contracts. The constitution clearly states, that a bill/law cannot specifically target any group of persons, individual, or specific organization/place of business. The law must cover all groups, all individuals, and all organizations/places of businesses.

So...if they want to go after Acorn to defund them based on giving tax advice to a man dressed as a pimp, and woman dressed a prostitute, or for voter registration fraud? Here's a list of organizations, people, and businesses that should also be defunded. Never allowed to gain any kind of funds from the government, or awarded any kind of government contracts:

Sen. John Ensign(R-NV): Not only did he have an affair with a staffer, he put her SON[19 years old] on the Republican payroll to shut her up. I.E. quid pro quo. He has essentially committed fraud by using RNC funds, to coverup personal indiscretions and affairs. His government contract should be terminated, and he should be barred from running for any future office/position where he would collect a government paycheck.

Gov. Mark Sanford(R-SC): Had an affair with a woman from Argentina. This isn't a big deal. Guy couldn't keep it in his pants. What is a big deal, is that he potentially used government money to fund his trips to Argentina to see his mistress under the guise of trade missions to South America. Fraud. Misuse of government funds. Should be forced to resign, and barred from holding any government office/position where he would collect government money.

Blackwater/XE: This is a PMC[Private Military Contractor] which is currently under investigation for multiple forms of fraud and breaking of many international laws and treaties. Illegal weapons smuggling, Illegal arms dealing, murder of Iraqi civilians. They should be defunded, and their government contract canceled, and barred from ever being contracted by the US government for ANYTHING ever again. Any PMC Soldier employed by Blackwater/XE after this defunding would immediately fall under the jurisdiction of whatever country that they happen to be in.

Lockheed Martin: They make everything from Weapons, Airplanes, Tanks, to Radar systems, and Satellites that are launched into space. Also, they've been investigated for multiple business ethics violations, and fraud by the US government, and have been fined a total of 11 times, totaling a little under 70 million dollars. Defund these people, and find someone else to make our fighter jets, missiles, tanks, guns, bullets, etc...Oh, lets not forget that we outsource in some states the census to them aswell.

Northrup Grumman: Also another one of our defense contractors that makes weapons, airplanes, tanks, radar systems, etc...They've also been hit up by the government for fraud and fined 9 times to the tune of 500 million dollars! The most egregious of these fraud cases being knowingly giving the Navy defective aircraft, price gouging the US government on space projects contracted to them, and knowingly giving the US Airforce satellite systems that were knowingly faulty and would more than likely fail. Oh, let's not forget their illegal gun running operation which they were caught shipping arms to China, Yemen, Angola and the Ukrain.

This is just a small sample of fraud that takes place to companies that are contracted by our very own government. There are tons more. My point is, is that if you want to defund Acorn for fraud, fine. But also defund every business, group, and person that also has a government contract, or receives government funding of some kind. Call up your congressman/congresswoman, senator and bring this to light.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"The whole ""defund"" Acorn","Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

7905,3275458,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/05/is-it-true-that-alternative-energy-is-too-expensive.html,"Many people assume that alternative energy is simply too expensive, and not competitive with oil and other conventional means of energy.

While some alternative writers allege that the big oil companies have artificially increased alternative energy prices by buying up promising alternative energy technologies – for example supposedly helping to kill first-generation electric cars by buying up promising battery patents so they couldn’t be used in electric models – we don’t even need to go down that rabbit hole.

Specifically, a 2008 report for Congress by the Congressional Research Service entitled “Renewable Energy R&D Funding History: A Comparison with Funding for Nuclear Energy, Fossil Energy, and Energy Efficiency R&D” notes:

Over the 30-year period from the Department of Energy’s inception at the beginning of fiscal Year (FY) 1978 through FY2007, federal spending for renewable energy R&D amounted to about 16% of the energy R&D total, compared with 15% for energy efficiency, 25% for fossil, and 41% for nuclear. For the 60-year period from 1948 through 2007, nearly 11% went to renewables, compared with 9% for efficiency, 25% for fossil, and 54% for nuclear.

In other words, renewable energy research and development received a small fraction of the R&D funding for nuclear and fossil fuels. This has skewed the market, making conventional energy sources cheaper and alternative sources more expensive.

In addition, when the externalities of environmental, military and terrorism costs are taken into account, conventional energy production is much more expensive than most people realize.

For example, as I wrote yesterday, the government has decided that deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf and other fragile and hard-to-drill regions – and securing oil in Iraq and other foreign regions – are in our national security and national energy policy interests (remember that Alan Greenspan, John McCain, George W. Bush, Sarah Palin, a high-level National Security Council officer and others all say that the Iraq war was really about oil).

Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that the Iraq war alone will cost $$3-5 trillion dollars.

And economist Anita Dancs writes:

Each year, our military devotes substantial resources to securing access to and safeguarding the transportation of oil and other energy sources. I estimate that we will pay $$90 billion this year to secure oil. If spending on the Iraq War is included, the total rises to $$166 billion.

In addition, experts say that the Iraq war has increased the threat of terrorism. See this, this, this, this, this, this and this.

The bottom line is that if alternative energy R&D was funded at the same level as conventional energy, and when the externalities of environmental, military and terrorism costs are taken into account, it is not clear that alternative energy is really substantially more expensive than conventional energy. At the very least, if the playing field were leveled, alternative energy could become cost competitive in the relatively near-term future.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Is It True that Alternative Energy Is Too Expensive?,"Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد",,[''],,,,

In some instances, working with the agency involves not much more than obtaining an investment from an agency-supported fund that is not actively administered or managed by the agency. In this case, a company 'client' of the agency does not have much of an engagement with the agency at all. In a sense, such jobs creation by the agency amounts to the jobs creation by the financial investors - they provide funds for jobs that are to be created - with or without them, sometimes - but they do not actively 'create' jobs. Net jobs created claim relates to gross increase in total employment during 2012 over 2011 final figure. This increase in its entirety does not accrue to the company activities with the agencies. For example, a mature enterprise can be engaged with an agency in developing new markets for exports. The enterprise might hire new workers for work totally unrelated to its engagement with the agency. Should the credit for these jobs additions go to the agency? Let's put this differently: suppose you broker a deal between companies 1 & 2 to purchase good X by 1 from 2. Should you get credit for company 1 buying from company 2 good A as well? Net jobs creation on the year 2011 assumes that these are new jobs added. This is also not true. It might be a job that replaces a layoff or redundancy that took place in 2011, but was not filled for 3-4 (or longer) months and thus hiring took place in 2012. What happens? Level of 2011 employment that serves as a base decreases by 1 job, level of employment in 2012 increases by 1. New jobs created = zero, yet Forfas study reports a net jobs creation of 1. The survey includes Ireland-based MNCs, which have multi-annual jobs rolls, so the point (4) above applies to their activities even more significantly than for domestic enterprises. 5,747 of the 8,975 jobs were 'created' in foreign-owned MNCs The survey also includes a number of larger internationally-trading Irish firms. Some of the jobs added could have been created and announced before the company was engaged with the state agency, but their filling was delayed until 2012 when the company was engaged with the agency. Many of the firms covered in the survey are mature and established firms and are no longer 'assisted' in any meaningful way by the state agencies, since they have long-term established operations in Ireland. A standard practice in business is when a broker of a deal gets a commission for the deal. The broker usually ceases to be compensated for any future deals signed by the two companies engaged in the original transaction once the original transaction is over. In the case of the Irish state agencies, the credit seems to flow unabated regardless of whether their work does directly contribute to the jobs creation or not. In some cases, 'net jobs created' by agencies-assisted companies can be actually poorly accounted jobs rotations within the economy. Example: an agency providing outsourcing service to, say, Nama moves into the country assisted by one of the international FDI agencies in the state. It creates 100 jobs that are counted as new. Yet it takes on 100 staff from the previously closed domestic agency that was not assisted by the agency. Net jobs creation in state agencies assisted companies +100. Net jobs creation in Irish economy = 0.





Per press reports today: ""IRELAND'S enterprise development agenciesnearly 9,000 net jobs in 2012, new statistics outlined."" The reports reference the findings of the Forfas 2012 Annual Employment Survey (linked at the bottom) which showed that ""total permanent full-time employment in agency-assisted companies operating in all sectors amounted to 294,785 in 2012, a net increase of 8,975 jobs or 3.1pc.""The quoted statement above is nonsensical and should not have been made. Here's why:These are at least some of the reasons why both the 8,975 jobs additions can be questioned and why in general none of these jobs were 'created' by the state agencies and not all of these jobs relate to the activities with which the state agencies are engaged.There is also a reason to question the very word 'permanent' jobs. If they are permanent, then why has the employment levels in agencies-assisted firms still running below 2006 peak? Permanent is permanent, right?And it really is not needed to make silly statements of this sort - some of the agencies - e.g. EI and IDA - are doing excellent work in many areas and are wanting in other. This is natural for any agency and any enterprise. The point is not to brow-beat them for the latter nor to ignore it, and it is also not to over-praise them for the former. What is needed is more precise and more transparent accounting and reporting. Alas, Forfas doesn't really deliver on that and never did. Instead we have a report full of chart, numbers and tables that offer little deep insight and even less real analysis.Full Forfas report is here: http://www.forfas.ie/media/04072013-Annual_Employment_Survey_2012-Publication.pdf",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Irish jobs creation, 2012 workforce, 2012 skills report, Irish labour force, FAS, Irish enterprises",,

The EU Commission published volumes of commissioned - made-to-order - research that shows just how brilliant an idea the FTT really is: it will raise loads of revenues, harm no one and will not reduce financial markets efficiency. Stopping just short of declaring the FTT to be a panacea to common cold, the EU enthusiastically propagandized the idea despite the simple fact that vast majority of academic research on the topic of transactions taxes finds that they are either ineffective as means for revenue raising or costly in terms of economic efficiency.





I wrote about this (see link at the bottom of this post below) and will continue to write, not because I long for an easy life for the bankers or financial investors, but because I recognise the fact that investment markets are necessary to the functioning of the society and the economy, and because I also recognise that more open, less restricted, but well-regulated and strictly enforced financial services are better than anything that Brussels et al can conceive in their technocratic dreams.





another study ( So in line with the past record, here's http://www.cpb.nl/en/publication/an-evaluation-of-the-financial-transaction-tax ) that explores ""...whether the FTT is likely to correct the market failures that have contributed to the financial crisis, how well the FTT is likely to succeed in raising revenues, and how the FTT compares to alternative taxes in terms of efficiency.""





The study finds (emphasis is mine) ""... little evidence that the FTT will be effective in correcting

market failures. Taxing of transactions is not well targeted at behaviour that leads to excessive risk and systemic risk creation. The empirical evidence does not suggest that the introduction of an FTT reduces volatility or asset price bubbles. Transaction taxes will likely reduce investment in trading activity and information acquisition, but also raise the costs of insurance against currency and interest risks by companies, insurers and pension funds. The welfare effect of that is unclear.""

""The FTT will likely raise significant revenues, in spite of the fact that the tax base is highly elastic. In the short term, the incidence of the tax will be chiefly on the current holders of securities. Ultimately, the tax will be borne in part by end users, and we estimate the likely effects on economic growth.""

""When compared to alternative forms of taxation of the financial sector, the FTT is likely less efficient given the amount of revenues. In particular, taxes that more directly address existing distortions (such as the current VAT exemption for banks, and the bias towards debt financing) provide more efficient alternatives.""

FTT - Financial Transactions Tax - has been the pet project of pure love for Eurocrats and Socialistas in the Member States, hungry for revenue. It has been labelled a 'Robin Hood Tax' because the politicians attempted to sell it as a tax on filthy-rich financial services to redistribute to starving unemployed, presumably, despite the simple fact that in the un-competitive and fragmented market for financial services that is Europe, such a tax - any tax - will be fully passed onto ordinary savers, investors, depositors and in general onto the users of financial services.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Tobin Tax, services exports, FTT, European reforms, CPB, European Services Directive, Open Europe, Financial Transactions Tax, Trade in Services, EU financial transactions tax",,

But it is not only a matter of covering up fraud that has already happened. The government also created an environment which greatly encouraged fraud.

Here are just a few of many potential examples:

The government-sponsored rating agencies committed massive fraud (and see this)

The Treasury department allowed banks to “cook their books”

Business Week wrote on May 23, 2006:

“President George W. Bush has bestowed on his intelligence czar, John Negroponte, broad authority, in the name of national security, to excuse publicly traded companies from their usual accounting and securities-disclosure obligations.”

Regulators knew of and allowed the use of debt-hiding accounting tricks by the big banks



Tim Geithner was complicit in Lehman’s accounting fraud, (and see this), and pushed to pay AIG’s CDS counterparties at full value, and then to keep the deal secret. And as Robert Reich notes, Geithner was “very much in the center of the action” regarding the secret bail out of Bear Stearns without Congressional approval. William Black points out: “Mr. Geithner, as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since October 2003, was one of those senior regulators who failed to take any effective regulatory action to prevent the crisis, but instead covered up its depth”

The former chief accountant for the SEC says that Bernanke and Paulson broke the law and should be prosecuted

Freddie and Fannie helped to create the epidemic of mortgage fraud

The government knew about mortgage fraud a long time ago. For example, the FBI warned of an “epidemic” of mortgage fraud in 2004. However, the FBI, DOJ and other government agencies then stood down and did nothing. See this and this. For example, the Federal Reserve turned its cheek and allowed massive fraud, and the SEC has repeatedly ignored accounting fraud. Indeed, Alan Greenspan took the position that fraud could never happen

Bernanke might have broken the law by letting unemployment rise in order to keep inflation low

Paulson and Bernanke falsely stated that the big banks receiving Tarp money were healthy, when they were not

Arguably, both the Bush and Obama administrations broke the law by refusing to close insolvent banks

Congress may have covered up illegal tax breaks for the big banks

Of course, deregulation by Larry Summers, Robert Rubin, Phil Gramm and many other high-level politicians and regulators also helped to grease the skids for fraud

Economist James K. Galbraith wrote in the introduction to his father, John Kenneth Galbraith’s, definitive study of the Great Depression, The Great Crash, 1929:



The main relevance of The Great Crash, 1929 to the great crisis of 2008 is surely here. In both cases, the government knew what it should do. Both times, it declined to do it. In the summer of 1929 a few stern words from on high, a rise in the discount rate, a tough investigation into the pyramid schemes of the day, and the house of cards on Wall Street would have tumbled before its fall destroyed the whole economy. In 2004, the FBI warned publicly of “an epidemic of mortgage fraud.” But the government did nothing, and less than nothing, delivering instead low interest rates, deregulation and clear signals that laws would not be enforced. The signals were not subtle: on one occasion the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision came to a conference with copies of the Federal Register and a chainsaw. There followed every manner of scheme to fleece the unsuspecting …. This was fraud, perpetrated in the first instance by the government on the population, and by the rich on the poor. *** The government that permits this to happen is complicit in a vast crime.

In other words, the fraud started at the very top with Greenspan, Bush, Paulson, Negraponte, Bernanke, Geithner, Rubin, Summers and all of the rest of the boys.

As William Black told me today:



In criminology jargon: they created an intensely criminogenic environment.

They can say ""Kill XYZ"" or ""We need to take so & so out"", or even ""All liberals should die...save for two on each campus..."" and think that nobody will take them seriously, or that their sphere of influence isn't so big, as it won't give someone justification and validation to act.

In reality, their spheres of influence cater to a very specific, but large group, the far right wing. And in that group, are it's outliers, the fringe people. The ones who sit on the fence, hanging on every word of people like this, waiting for justification, and validation to act. The ones who secretly plot to overthrow government officials, or take up arms against elected officials, shoot cops, etc..., but all they are waiting for, is that ONE person who has enough clout or fame, or group of people to come out publicly, and say what they believe privately in their hearts and minds. Someone to validate their actions. They say the things they say, KNOWING THIS. They KNOW that there are those, who would take their words literally, and act on them. They HOPE that they don't act, but deep down inside, they KNOW that there are those out there who hang on every word they say, and are just waiting for that one statement of validation.

I've had this argument with friends over this in the past few days, that a person is ultimately responsible for their own actions and whatever a person says, bears no direct responsibility on the actions of another. And to a certain extent, that is true. Most everyday people don't have a very large sphere of influence, if one at all. People who KNOW YOU, they KNOW the kind of person you are, and deep down they know most of what you say is just words, and that it would take a very extreme act for you follow through on them. Like when you tell someone ""Someone should take him behind the building and beat the piss out of him"", they know you're not serious. Also, you don't hold enough sway over someone, or a group of people to get them to act on your behalf to carry out said beating. You wouldn't be mad if it happened, but you wouldn't justify it being done either. In the end, for the most part, you know the personalities of the people you associate with, and what they would and would not do. You know what you CAN say, and CANNOT say around them.

Now in the case of your right wing politicos, talking heads, pundits, elected officials, commentators, etc... who say these hate filled, and divisive statements, is that their message is getting through to hundreds of thousands, and potentially millions of people. They don't know the personalities of each and every person that they have the ear of. Most of these people, their target audience are already angry, and seething over problems both real and ginned up, but are also rational people for the most part. They KNOW not to take everything literally. They KNOW Rush Limbaugh does not advocate murder, or that elected officials don't advocate the taking up of guns against other elected officials that they do not agree with ideologically. BUT There are the fringe people who also get that message. And to them the call to arms is a message of justification. A message of ""What I believe is RIGHT because an elected official/main stream commentator/person running for high elected office said it!"" This is all they need in order to get off the fence and act. A rallying cry of sorts.

So yes, I do believe in the first amendment. Say what you feel. But don't be surprised when some psycho does something, because you KNOWINGLY gave validation to their cause with YOUR inflammatory speech. I heard this in a rap song, and I think it aptly applies to hate speech and rhetoric in the political climate today.

7918,3275473,dailykos.com,political,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2011/1/18/937181/-,"First, before I go on, I'd like you to know a little bit about myself. I'm a 30 year old black/hispanic male, originally from Newark New Jersey. I'm a former member of the US Army Reserves. In my youth, I've been shot at inadvertently, and on purpose in my neighborhood in Newark NJ in the mid to late 90s several times. As an adult, I've been to many states in our country, as well as other countries all over the world [Jamaica, Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany and Brazil]. My political ideology is not purely liberal, purely republican, or purely conservative [I don't consider being a republican and conservative the same thing]. I would consider myself an independent.

So, lets get to the question. Why are we as a nation so obsessed with guns? Why are we as a nation so violent? Every time you turn around, we hear about some gun violence. Someone who legally obtained a gun, and went on some violent shooting spree, someone who's been murdered via shooting, some kid who got their hands on a gun, and decides to shoot up his school [Coincidentally, as I'm writing this at 3:11pm est, there's a shooting going on right now in Los Angeles at a school.], some disgruntled worker going on a murderous rampage with gun in hand. Why do you mainly hear about these things here in the United States, but rarely in other first world countries such as England, Japan, Germany, Canada, etc...?

In this country, there's no uniformity on access to guns, or how one goes about obtaining them. I remember when I went to Canada, and read that for every 4 people in Canada, 1 of them legally owns a gun. Canada has a population of roughly 36 million people. Yet in Canada, there are only a few hundred gun related murders/homicides per year. There's also uniformity in Canada in it's gun laws. It's a federal law, not by individual province. Here are some of the requirements in order to get a gun in Canada:

- Every time you purchase a gun, you MUST take a gun safety class. No matter how many guns you have purchased before, this is a requirement. - There is a 28 day waiting period on ALL guns purchased. - IF you are married, or WERE married, you must get written permission from your spouse, or ex-spouse saying that it is ok for you own a gun. - Extensive criminal, and medical background checks are performed during the 28 day waiting period to see if any red flags pop up. IE felony charges, drug charges, mental health issues. - ON THE DAY you receive your gun, it is licensed and registered in the national database with YOU as it's owner. YOU are responsible for the gun, and only YOU are authorized to use that gun.

Those are just some of the simple rules that prevent wide spread gun violence in Canada. There is also a ban on high capacity magazines, and automatic weaponry [you need a special permit from the CFO of the province and permission from the federal government itself to sell and/or own one]. A country that a higher ratio of people with gun ownership than the United States, yet nowhere near the level of gun related violence.

Another thing I was surprised to learn, is that the vast majority of legal gun owners, are people who live in areas, where there is virtually no danger of violence against them. Suburbs, rural areas. The vast majority of gun owners are middle - upper middle class white people. But what causes these people to go out in mass, and purchase guns? And as pointed out by Michael Moore yesterday on The Rachael Maddow show, the answer is simple: Irrational Fear

Why do white people in this country that own guns, have an irrational fear of some poor person, or minority coming into their home, and robbing them while they are there? As Moore pointed out, there are only roughly 500 home invasion deaths in the United States per year. In a country of almost 400 million people, and of all homicides committed in this country, 500 of those are via home invasion. You are more likely to die from food poisoning [roughly 9000 people die from it a year in the US], than you are from being killed during a home invasion. And of those that are killed during a home invasion, approximately 1/3rd of those people, are killed by weapons that are in the home already. IE the robber found their gun, and killed them with it, or the robber disarmed the owner of the gun, and killed him/her with it.

Which brings me to another thing people in this country are so passionate about: Carry and conceal. Why do people feel the need to carry a gun in public? From a person who has been around guns in some way or another since the age of 8, I can tell you that carrying a gun in public, does not make you any safer. I mean, what is it with the romanticism of carrying a gun in public? It's not going to prevent you from being robbed. What are you going to do? Attempt to throw down on the robber and turn the tables? News flash, it's only going to get you killed. Because you have to: Un-holster your weapon, turn around if the robber is to your back, then fire. By then, the robber would have stabbed, or shot you. You'll be on the ground, in a pool of your own blood, seriously wounded, or even dead because you thought this was the wild west.

Another thing I hear alot, is that it would enable you to help out in one of these situations where someone has a gun and is shooting up the place and other innocent people. Like in the case of Tuscon, a lot of people say ""Well if there had been a gun owner on the scene or near by, he or she could have defused the situation."" Well, that is not the case. As stated on Jan 13th on The Rachael Maddow show.

This guy, almost shot one of the people responsible for disarming that lunatic during the shooting at Congresswoman Giffords' appearance where she and several others were shot. As a person who owns guns, has shot at people, and has been shot at, I can tell you, that your first instinct, is to shoot at the person holding the gun. You don't take time to assess the situation. Lets take it one step further. You, as a bystander, not directly involved in the conflict, and your life in no immediate danger, decide to intercede and take down the person with the gun who is shooting up the place, thinking you're going to be a hero. WRONG! You, as a law abiding citizen, and legal gun owner, have just committed assault with a deadly weapon, attempted murder, and if the person dies, homicide. But how can this be? You're a hero, right? You stopped the bad guy. WRONG! You, are not law enforcement, or acting on behalf of any law enforcement agency with their permission i.e. deputized. Your life was in no immediate danger, as you were not in the immediate area where the shooting was going on. So yea... while I am all for gun ownership, carry and conceal is just a stupid idea, because it solves nothing, and prevents nothing.

I'm all for gun reform. Stricter, and uniform federal laws like many countries such as Germany, Canada, and England. But people who are pro-gun will cry from the mountain tops ""The federal government can't take our guns! We need to be ready in case we need to revolt! We have a second amendment for a reason!"". I just tend to laugh at those people. Because seriously people, if any president were use the US military against the citizens of the United States, no amount of guns will stop the US military from doing what they do. Civilians do not have access to anything near what the military has. Civilians don't have tanks, apc's, bombers, high powered explosives, gunships, jets, missiles, rockets, grenades, near limitless supplies of ammo, high caliber machine guns and automatic rifles, armored vehicles, etc... that's just off the top of my head.

I really think we should be able in this country, to enact stricter gun laws because if we don't, I don't see the future of this country looking very bright.

So please...",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Why are we so violent and obsessed with guns?,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,
7919,3275477,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,https://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/Wages%20in%20Ireland,"For those who missed my Sunday Times article last, here is the unedited version. For more on education premium in Ireland see my Long Run Economics blog here

Box-out:

Remember the wave of protests hitting the streets over the withdrawal of the automatic entitlement to the senior citizens’ health cards – a benefit worth some €2,500 per annum for a well-to-do family of two? As the Government studies this month’s report on the options for the reintroduction of third-level fees, the prospect of taking out some €5,700-7,300 from the already stretched middle classes has to be an equivalent of a nightmare in our Ministers’ heads. Unlike the elderly, these are the same families hit hard by Minister Lenihan’s tax war on Ireland Inc.Politics aside, this level of radical pain therapy would be warranted were it to deliver improved quality of education. Alas, the plan is so fundamentally flawed that one must wonder if serious economic impact assessment of its proposals was even attempted.The Department of Education report suggests, as a clearly preferred option, setting fixed fees of €5,715 for arts and humanities students and €7,272 for nursing and engineering. While these differentials somewhat reflect the variation in capital between the two broad categories of programmes, these are hardly sufficient to establish proper pricing of education. Neither do they recognise the differences in the costs of non-capital inputs, such as faculty salaries.In other words, the idea of fixed, uniform pricing independent of quality or institution’s ability to attract top internationally competitive students and faculty is about as daft as charging a single price for all cars. Do this, and within years you’ll get an overpriced mediocre labour force.Two features of the Irish market for education amplify this negative effect of fixed pricing.The first feature is extreme over-proliferation of third level institutions. In normal circumstances, when price reflects quality differences between competitors, the markets regulate the new entries and the survival of the incumbent colleges, institutes and universities. But absent pricing mechanism and with politically motivated education expenditure allocations you get a competition driven by the race to increase numbers of degrees awarded. A race to excellence is replaced by a race to graduation and grades inflation. Do we, as a nation, want certified mediocrity for the indigenous labour force? If not, we should allow our universities to charge a market rate for their services.The second feature relates to the market for education. For all our talk about the knowledge economy Irish wages are driven primarily by tenure. Per latest CSO data, released last week, even at the peak of the boom in 2007, Irish workers collected low earnings premia per each additional year of investment in education compared to tenure. Chart illustrates. After-tax real annual earnings gains from moving from post-leaving cert level of education to a 3rd level non-degree education are lower than those from staying in the workforce. This is true for all types of potential students, with exception of mature female students. A picture is better for those planning to invest in a full 3rd level degree or higher, but even here the premium earned falls below the price to be charged under the proposed reform. That was before the latest decimation of jobs, wage rates and bonuses associated with the current recession. In other words, given the labour market-enshrined system of tenure-driven rewards, education does not really pay in Ireland. Staying in the job does. This is likely to explain why on average more educated EU15 foreign nationals (excluding UK and Ireland) have earned some 9.6% less in hourly wages in 2007 than their Irish counterparts. For males, the same number was a whooping 14%. Per CSO data, not a single sector in Ireland yields an education premium in excess of the upper marginal tax rate other than our knowledge-thirsty public sector. And even there, only females earn such a premium.This makes it even more crucial for the reform of education financing to be focused on long term objective of creating a functional market pricing of human capital – skills, schooling and aptitude. On a deeper level, such a reform should be linked with a rapid shift away from the system that rewards tenure and taxes heavily educational attainment and resultant skills. In other words, we need more after-tax wage inequality based on skills and educational attainment differentials before we can charge a real price of education. But at the level of education reform itself, we need a system of fees that differentiates between degrees of varying quality, incentivises student effort and merit.The main mistake of the proposed fees system is that it sets singular pricing for all degrees independent of quality or the variations in the demand for specific degrees in the market place.For example, if the country is experiencing a reduced supply of engineering and hard science personnel, as FAS and Forfas have asserted on so many occasions, surely we should witness a combination of lower fees (due to smaller demand for admissions from the potential students) and higher wages emerging. Under the latest Department of Education proposal, we will get exactly the opposite.Similarly, if our two world-class institutions, TCD and UCD, were to offer their degrees at the exact same price as those offered by less internationally recognisable schools, this society will be underpaying for their services and overpaying for lower quality universities and schools. This is hardly a system that can be expected to yield economically and socially efficient outcomes.Bizarrely, our education mandarins claimed in the report that allowing institutions to vary the price of admission can lead to some charging “excessively high fee rates, perhaps resting more on reputation than service”. This is economically illiterate and smacks of an outright manipulation of the market.The second grave mistake is not to create a fully diversified and functional system of state-supported lending for tuition fees coverage and merit-based grants. Such a system, for obvious reasons, should be accessible only to the children of Irish citizens and long-term (8-10 years plus) residents. It should be coupled with a University-driven system of own merit grants open to all candidates to attract star applicants from abroad.It should also work seamlessly with the means-tested system of supports. The much-lauded Australian option (or Option 3a in the report terminology) will simply not work for a small open economy like Ireland that is a temporary migration attractor within a much larger EU. Judging by the fact that the Department of Education expects the cost of running the scheme to be roughly equivalent to only 3-4% of the set up cost, I doubt they counted on the potential education tourism and skills drain to be of any significant magnitude.And yet, our own Government expects some 150,000 Irish people to leave this country in the current recession alone. How many of these new emigrants will carry with them above average levels of education attainment is an open question. However, were we to have the proposed fees system in place today, the Government migration solution to the crisis could be washing away some €800-1,200mln in educational investment out of the country.The last error of judgement by the Department of Education is to address the issue of fees separately from the overall financing of academia. Even assuming that our mandarins’ numbers stand up to scrutiny, there is no added certainty as to the future income for the academic institutions in this country. How much of the current funding will the fees replace? How will the fees revenue be distributed across various institutions? Who will be responsible for financing of uncompetitive institutions? All of these and other questions remain unasked. Which suggests that the fees reform will be nothing more than a plaster on a gapping wound that is our system of education.This month’s ECB Bulletin on the Euro area economy included an interesting model for estimating the sovereign bond spreads as a function of public debt to GDP ratio, public deficits, the volumes of bond financing required in the future, past yields and the measure of international financial markets’ willingness to accept investment risk. The original ECB estimation was based on the yields history for 10 Euro area countries, including Ireland. Recalibrated forward to reflect the expected changes in our fiscal position in years to come, this model predicts Irish bonds spreads over the German bund to increase by roughly 40-50% through 2013 assuming NAMA bonds are held off the public balance sheet and have no impact on the market demand for our bonds. Under less favourable conditions, with NAMA bonds entering public balance sheet and demand for Irish bonds falling to the level where the ECB becomes the sole purchaser of bond, market yields spreads can rise by some 200%.

I am a skeptic when it comes to the idea of Fair Trade - an idea that on its surface suggests that we should use our preferences biases in the West to determine winners and losers in the trade game vis-a-vis the rest of the world.However, for some time now, I am hearing various noises about evidence on superior returns to fair trade-affiliated enterprises. Again, taking this with a grain of salt suggests that some of this effect, if true, can be attributed to the artificially increased market share of the fair trade-affiliated producer: I buy Fair Trade, so I discriminate against non-affiliated producer, thereby increasing the market share of a Fair Trade-affiliated one. On the other hand, some theory might suggest that FT-affiliated producers can benefit from higher productivity of better paid and better incentivize employees or coop-members.is a recent (July 1, 2009) study from Leonardo Becchetti and Stefano Castriota (UofRome II) published by CEIS Tor Vergata, Research paper 141, Vol 7 Issue 1 (available here ). The study evaluates the impact of FT affiliation on Chilean honey producers. ""Evidence from standard regressions ...shows that affiliated farmers have higher productivity (income from honey per worked hour) than the control sample. Additional results on the effects of affiliation on training, cooperation and advances on payments suggest that affiliation contributed both to, and independently from, the economies of scale effect. Therefore, we show that the productivity effect is partially explained by the superior capacity of affiliated workers to exploit economies of scale.""In other words, what they do find is that FT link to productivity is a mixed bag. One issue - the beggar thy competitor effect of FT (scale) is certainly contributive to 'higher' productivity. As FT spreads over more and more producers, this effect will diminish. The paper controls for this effect.Another issue is the price effect of FT - members of FT programmes receive higher prices for their products because we, consumers, are willing to pay that premium. This implies that per fixed number of units revenue of FT-affiliated producers is artificially inflated by our preferences. Again, should FT spread, this effect will also be driven down to nil. Interestingly, the authors report that in the case of Chilean honey producers, ""The (wholesale) price of honey sold to the FT affiliated cooperative is obviously lower than the retail price, but surprisingly is also lower than the price paid by local, traditional and international intermediaries. Beyond the myth of higher prices, the most valuable services provided by FT organizations are price and demand stabilization, training courses, technical assistance (in this case, lab tests on honey chemical properties) and zero interest advance payments.

On the other hand, some theory might suggest that FT-affiliated producers can benefit from higher productivity of better paid and better incentivize employees or coop-members.is a recent (July 1, 2009) study from Leonardo Becchetti and Stefano Castriota (UofRome II) published by CEIS Tor Vergata, Research paper 141, Vol 7 Issue 1 (available here ). The study evaluates the impact of FT affiliation on Chilean honey producers. ""Evidence from standard regressions ...shows that affiliated farmers have higher productivity (income from honey per worked hour) than the control sample. Additional results on the effects of affiliation on training, cooperation and advances on payments suggest that affiliation contributed both to, and independently from, the economies of scale effect. Therefore, we show that the productivity effect is partially explained by the superior capacity of affiliated workers to exploit economies of scale.""In other words, what they do find is that FT link to productivity is a mixed bag. One issue - the beggar thy competitor effect of FT (scale) is certainly contributive to 'higher' productivity. As FT spreads over more and more producers, this effect will diminish. The paper controls for this effect.Another issue is the price effect of FT - members of FT programmes receive higher prices for their products because we, consumers, are willing to pay that premium. This implies that per fixed number of units revenue of FT-affiliated producers is artificially inflated by our preferences. Again, should FT spread, this effect will also be driven down to nil. Interestingly, the authors report that in the case of Chilean honey producers, ""The (wholesale) price of honey sold to the FT affiliated cooperative is obviously lower than the retail price, but surprisingly is also lower than the price paid by local, traditional and international intermediaries. Beyond the myth of higher prices, the most valuable services provided by FT organizations are price and demand stabilization, training courses, technical assistance (in this case, lab tests on honey chemical properties) and zero interest advance payments. The local retail price is lower for Apicoop’s members, thus there are no positive externalities of FT affiliation on their bargaining power with local buyers.""But the most interesting issue from my point of view is what is left as a 'residual' once the above two factors are accounted for. Controlling for selection bias, authors estimate the following relationship relating to output productivity: and obtain the following results: This is really exciting evidence from my point of view (and do recall - I am a skeptic): authors' ""analysis on Chilean honey producers in a period of high market prices highlights that, beyond the fair price myth,... More specifically, ...FT affiliation, in spite of an insignificant price differential in times of rising market prices, has helped local farmers to improve their productive skills across years. In this process more favorable financial conditions (advances on payments at 0% interest rate), internalization of Marshallian externalities via interactions among local producers and training courses are the distinguishing features with respect to a control sample of non affiliated producers which seem to have paid an important role.""Great stuff... but... ""On the overall, our findings show that affiliation years significantly contribute to increase producers’ productivity by moving farmers above the inverse U-shaped average product curve in the sample.

7925,3275488,thedailybeast.com,political,https://www.thedailybeast.com/japans-new-secrets-bill-threatens-to-muzzle-the-press-and-whistleblowers,"The best way to deal with foul smelling things is to put a lid over them ( 臭いものに蓋をする ) --Japanese proverb

The Japanese government, which already has a long history of cover-ups and opaqueness, is on its way to becoming even less open and transparent after the lower house the Diet, Japan’s parliament, passed the Designated Secrets Bill on Tuesday. With new powers to classify nearly anything as a state secret and harsh punishments for leakers that can easily be used to intimidate whistleblowers and stifle press freedom, many in Japan worry that the if the bill becomes law it will be only the first step towards even more severe erosions of freedom in the country.

The bill, which can criminalize investigative reporting of the government or its policies, still needs to pass the Diet’s upper house to become law and is meeting some last minute opposition on its way there. In politically complacent Japan, thousands of citizens took to the street in the last two weeks to protest the measure. Diet members are voicing disapproval and news organizations are standing opposed. Even cute Japanese celebrities have voiced their opposition, a sure sign that this is serious business in the land of the rising sun. Last week, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights voiced their disapproval and concerns, noting the “the Secrets bill threatens transparency… (it) includes serious threats to whistle-blowers and even journalists reporting on secrets”.

With only 30% of the public supporting them, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the Liberal Democratic Party bloc pushed the legislation ostensibly to “ensure that Japan can share secrets with the US and other countries”. However, even politicians inside the ruling bloc are saying, “It can’t be denied that another purpose is to muzzle the press, shut up whistleblowers, and ensure that the nuclear disaster at Fukushima ceases to be an embarrassment before the Olympics.”

The Special Secrets Bill is based on a failed anti-spying bill proposed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone (LDP) in the 1980s. Currently there are already several laws on the books that punish civil servants for leaking secret information obtained on the job. The new law would enact harsher punishment to leakers and ominously would allow journalists who obtained information by “inappropriate means” and whistleblowers to be jailed for up to ten years. The law would also allow the police to raid the offices of media organizations and seize evidence at their discretion.

Under the law government branches other than the defense ministry would have the power to designate information as state secrets. The bill has even grants no longer existent agencies the power to classify secrets.

The law names four categories of ‘special secrets’, which would be covered by protection – national security, diplomacy, counter-terrorism and counter-espionage. Yet, despite the bill’s enlargement of the state’s power over information, it contains no oversight process to act as a check on ministries and government agencies designating large amounts of information as ‘secret’ for capricious or self-interested reasons.

Under the new law, the Ministry of Financial Services could put a lid on the scandal of mega-banks loaning money to the yakuza, Japan’s mafia, by classifying their “business improvement orders” as matters of national security and making them state secrets. The SESC could declare the reasons for delisting a company from the stock exchange “classified” for similar reasons. This is not reassuring of those wishing to invest in the Japanese stock market, which has already been dogged by compliance and disclosure issues.

And most tellingly, Masako Mori, the Minister of Justice, has declared that nuclear related information will most likely be a designated secret. For the Abe administration this would be fantastic way to deal with the issue of tons of radiated water leaking from the Fukushima Daichi Nuclear Power Plant since the triple meltdown in March of 2011. There seems to be no end to stopping the toxic waste leaks there but the new legislation would allow the administration to plug the information leaks permanently.

As the radioactive water from Japan’s nuclear disaster continues to pour into the ocean and our food supply, it is an ominous sign that the Japanese government refuses to disclose information about the levels of pollution or timely information about the next nuclear accident. And security issues at Japan’s nuclear power plants being, which hold enough plutonium to make hundreds of atomic weapons, including reports that they’re manned by the yakuza, could also be hidden by under the guise of state secrets.

Before Japan was selected to host the 2020 Olympics, Prime Minister Abe spoke at the General Meeting of the International Olympic Committee, where he assured them, “The Fukushima nuclear accident is under control.” This was followed by revelations of large amounts of radioactive water leaking from the power plant, and the remaining water tanks emitting radiation levels so high that anyone working around them would be exposed to a lethal dose within hours. It made Abe look perfidious or clueless or both. He seems anxious not to lose face again.

Mizuho Fukushima, former leader of the Social Democratic Party, compared the bill to the pre-World War II Peace Maintenance Preservation Laws and other Secrecy laws at the time, remarking that there was a time in police-state Japan when the weather reports could be considered “secret.”

““Once you open the door to such kind of laws, the government will have the right to designate anything as a state secret and by speaking about it or mentioning it, you can be arrested and prosecuted.” Ms. Fukushima explained, “Especially during war time, it was very difficult for defendants and lawyers to fight their court cases, because they were not told what exactly what was the state secret that they had been accused of having revealed.”

Outspoken Upper House Councilor Taro Yamamoto, who is known to be a strong supporter of investigative journalism, minces no words: “The path that Japan is taking is the recreation of a fascist state. I strongly believe that this secrecy bill represents a planned coup d’état by a group of politicians and bureaucrats,” he warned.

While his statement may seem alarmist, even a senior official of the National Police Agency agrees. “I would say this is Abe’s attempt to make sure that his own shady issues aren’t brought to light, and a misuse of legislative power.

Ironically, In a country that worships cute celebrities, the first real reporting on the problems with the bill began in September, when Norika Fujiwara, an actress who is also the goodwill ambassador for the Japanese Red Cross, came out against the law on her blog. She indicated it would threaten freedom of speech and democracy itself and urged her fans to pressure the government to kill the bill. When a beautiful celebrity takes up arms against legislation in Japan, even the media takes notice. And after taking notice, they didn’t like what they found.

The Japan Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association, the Civil Broadcasters Federation, and most major news organizations in Japan’s have expressed staunch opposition to the bill. In a rare journey into the political arena, even The Foreign Correspondent’s Club of Japan, which includes both Japanese journalists and non-resident journalists, issued a strong protest against the bill on November 11th. The Japanese media, almost without exception、reported the details of the statement.

“We are alarmed by the text of the bill… relating to the potential targeting of journalists for prosecution and imprisonment. It is at the very heart of investigative journalism in open societies to uncover secrets and to inform the people about the activities of government. Such journalism is not a crime, but rather a crucial part of the checks-and-balances that go hand-in-hand with democracy. The current text of the bill seems to suggest that freedom of the press is no longer a constitutional right, but merely something for which government officials “must show sufficient consideration.” Moreover, the “Designated Secrets Bill” specifically warns journalists that they must not engage in “inappropriate methods” in conducting investigations of government policy. This appears to be a direct threat aimed at the media profession and is unacceptably open to wide interpretations in individual cases. Such vague language could be, in effect, a license for government officials to prosecute journalists almost as they please.”

If history does repeat itself, it would seem very likely that as Ms. Fukushima fears, Japan is about to take a giant step back into its oppressive past. When one also considers Prime Minister Abe’s stated ambition to restart Japan’s nuclear power plants and remove Article 9 from the constitution, the article which prevents Japan from waging war, it seems like the Empire of The Sun may be moving towards darker times.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Japan’s new Secrets Bill Threatens To Muzzle The Press and Whistleblowers,"Etc Authors J Jake-Adelstein, Etc Authors N Nathalie-Kyoko-Stucky, Jake Adelstein, Nathalie-Kyoko Stucky",,"['Japan', 'Classified information', 'Nuclear power', 'Three Mile Island accident', 'Chernobyl disaster']","An ominous new bill in Japan, on its way to becoming law, would give the government expanded powers to classify nearly anything as a secret and intimidate the press into silence.",,,

longer hours of access to entertainment,



better quality of music and dancing environments,



more regulated and safer entertainment conditions,



better trained staff etc



Table 1.6 on page 9, shows that annual licensing costs to operate nightclubs in Ireland are 8.91% of the total nightclub sector turnover. This is 31 times greater than licensing costs for operating an ordinary on-trade venue and 99 times greater than the off-license licensing cost; nightclubs have to maintain larger physical premises than other on-license venues (e.g at least 20% of the floorspace in the nightclub will be allocated to a dancefloor, which yeilds no drink-related revenue);

nightclubs operate shorter daily and weekly hours (section 3.7 of the report and Table 3.7); nightclubs face higher rate of amortization of premises (section 3.4); nightclubs maintain higher ratio of staff to clients than oridnary venues (Table 3.7); nightclubs have higher capital cost per each person entertained than other on-license venues (section 3.7 of my report); Table 3.7 in my report clearly states various areas of operations, relating to technology, space utilization and staff requirements, where nightclubs are incurring higher costs than other on-license premises. In fact, of 10 areas related to the subject of my research, 7 show higher cost of operations for the nightclubs; Tables 3.5 and 3.6 show that out of the expected gains in alcohol sales of €122mln pa due to reforms, the Exchequer will receive some €62mln in alcholo-related tax revenues. Roughly 50%, overall value added to the Exchequer will increase by over 2 times tha rate of increase in the value added attributable to labour and 30% more than the value added attributable to physical capital stock. Since roughly 89% of this increase is expected to come from substitution away from home consumption of alcohol, these figures clearly show a vast differences in tax-induced costs of alcohol consumption at home and in the licensed premises.

A quick reply to a box-out by Liam Fay in the main section of thewith a critique of the Irish Nightclubs Industry Association (INIA) report, launched last week, which was prepared by me.I like Liam's column and was certainly amused by his allegory for my economic career. Not being familiar with Mrs Sophie Ellis-Baxtor's career or personality, I would presume that Liam's reference is a positive one, especially given my suspicion that he is familiar with my established credentials as a champion of competitive and lower cost markets for consumer services and goods and the opponent of the rip-off culture that is a feature of some areas of our economy.Liam has an acute eye for bulls**t and he spotted something that was missing in my report. ""But one of the chief reasons most adults avoid nightclubs is the extortionate prices charged for booze. If Gurdgiev had surveyed the nightlife scene from the punter's perspective, he would've discovered that it's actually the greed of club owners that's killing the groove"".Liam is correct to say that my report was not based on the 'punter's perspective'. I was asked to provide a professional opinion on specific proposals presented by the INIA, not to conduct a general research into what is right or wrong with the industry. Like a lawyer providing a specific client advice, I have my remit and scope of research, and this remit is clearly identified in the title of the report.But Liam is incorrect to imply that the different approach of my report somehow acts to glance over ""the greed of club owners that's killing the groove"". If high cost is a deterrent to night clubs attendance, then, as I hope Liam would agree, reducing this cost would help.Reducing this cost can be done via many alternative ways. Cutting the price of drinks is one, but it is not the policy objective of any of our policymakers, so to deal with high cost of drink, induced by high taxation structure, in a legislative proposal framework would be a waste of time and effort.Other charges do enter the determination of the cost of entertainment in a nightclub alongside the price of drink. My report clearly shows that these charges can be made more competitive, allowing a punter buying the same drink for the same price to enjoy more entertainment per Euro spent. These are:These benefits are to be delivered as a result of the reforms I was asked to evaluate and these benefits surely provide better value for money to a punter. So, Liam's argument that high cost of drink matters to the decisions made by the punters does not clash with the report findings - it actually supports them.I do not compare costs of drink in different types of licensed venues, nor do I provide any assessment as to whether a price of drink premium in Irish nightclubs over that of other licensed venues is out of line with other countries. My work did not require this and none of my conclusions depend on any assumptions or inputs relating to these, otherwise very interesting, comparisons.But even if there are such differentials, to suggest that price of drink is high in the nightclubs (in absolute terms or in relative terms, compared to elsewhere) due to 'greed' of the nightclubs owners is simplistic. My report supplies evidence to show that, at least in part, the cost of drink in the nightclubs is driven by external factors other than 'greed':The bottom line is - over 50% of what we pay in a nightclub for a drink has absolutely nothing to do with the nightclub owner's profit line. The above points - all clearly identified in the report - suggest that the cost of drink to the punter might be driven by the greed and/or other considerations of the Exchequer.Once again, Liam is correct, this is not a report written from a punter's perspective. As much as I would have loved to work on such an exciting topic of research, limitations of time, resources and brief require that this research be postponed for the future. Economics, like legal profession, is a field of professional inquiry and this means that one works within a given brief.However, I see no evidence to suggest at this moment in time that the industry I describe in the report is driven by some exceptional greed or short-termist pricing policies that are killing the groove.If anything, there is evidence in the report to show that the opposite is true. For example, the proposals for nightclub permit set very strict and costly (to the owners) parameters for what constitutes a nightclub. This is not done because there is a pursuit of a groove-killing quick profit, but because the sector participants have recognised the need to explicitly focus on long-term sector development.The end result of these proposals would be to deliver better value for money for the punters and safer and more responsible entertainment from the social point of view. These are hardly the reforms a 'greedy' profit-stripping business owner would subscribe to.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Nightclubs industry report, INIA report",,

longer hours of access to entertainment,



better quality of music and dancing environments,



more regulated and safer entertainment conditions,



better trained staff etc



Table 1.6 on page 9, shows that annual licensing costs to operate nightclubs in Ireland are 8.91% of the total nightclub sector turnover. This is 31 times greater than licensing costs for operating an ordinary on-trade venue and 99 times greater than the off-license licensing cost; nightclubs have to maintain larger physical premises than other on-license venues (e.g at least 20% of the floorspace in the nightclub will be allocated to a dancefloor, which yeilds no drink-related revenue);

nightclubs operate shorter daily and weekly hours (section 3.7 of the report and Table 3.7); nightclubs face higher rate of amortization of premises (section 3.4); nightclubs maintain higher ratio of staff to clients than oridnary venues (Table 3.7); nightclubs have higher capital cost per each person entertained than other on-license venues (section 3.7 of my report); Table 3.7 in my report clearly states various areas of operations, relating to technology, space utilization and staff requirements, where nightclubs are incurring higher costs than other on-license premises. In fact, of 10 areas related to the subject of my research, 7 show higher cost of operations for the nightclubs; Tables 3.5 and 3.6 show that out of the expected gains in alcohol sales of €122mln pa due to reforms, the Exchequer will receive some €62mln in alcholo-related tax revenues. Roughly 50%, overall value added to the Exchequer will increase by over 2 times tha rate of increase in the value added attributable to labour and 30% more than the value added attributable to physical capital stock. Since roughly 89% of this increase is expected to come from substitution away from home consumption of alcohol, these figures clearly show a vast differences in tax-induced costs of alcohol consumption at home and in the licensed premises.

A quick reply to a box-out by Liam Fay in the main section of thewith a critique of the Irish Nightclubs Industry Association (INIA) report, launched last week, which was prepared by me.I like Liam's column and was certainly amused by his allegory for my economic career. Not being familiar with Mrs Sophie Ellis-Baxtor's career or personality, I would presume that Liam's reference is a positive one, especially given my suspicion that he is familiar with my established credentials as a champion of competitive and lower cost markets for consumer services and goods and the opponent of the rip-off culture that is a feature of some areas of our economy.Liam has an acute eye for bulls**t and he spotted something that was missing in my report. ""But one of the chief reasons most adults avoid nightclubs is the extortionate prices charged for booze. If Gurdgiev had surveyed the nightlife scene from the punter's perspective, he would've discovered that it's actually the greed of club owners that's killing the groove"".Liam is correct to say that my report was not based on the 'punter's perspective'. I was asked to provide a professional opinion on specific proposals presented by the INIA, not to conduct a general research into what is right or wrong with the industry. Like a lawyer providing a specific client advice, I have my remit and scope of research, and this remit is clearly identified in the title of the report.But Liam is incorrect to imply that the different approach of my report somehow acts to glance over ""the greed of club owners that's killing the groove"". If high cost is a deterrent to night clubs attendance, then, as I hope Liam would agree, reducing this cost would help.Reducing this cost can be done via many alternative ways. Cutting the price of drinks is one, but it is not the policy objective of any of our policymakers, so to deal with high cost of drink, induced by high taxation structure, in a legislative proposal framework would be a waste of time and effort.Other charges do enter the determination of the cost of entertainment in a nightclub alongside the price of drink. My report clearly shows that these charges can be made more competitive, allowing a punter buying the same drink for the same price to enjoy more entertainment per Euro spent. These are:These benefits are to be delivered as a result of the reforms I was asked to evaluate and these benefits surely provide better value for money to a punter. So, Liam's argument that high cost of drink matters to the decisions made by the punters does not clash with the report findings - it actually supports them.I do not compare costs of drink in different types of licensed venues, nor do I provide any assessment as to whether a price of drink premium in Irish nightclubs over that of other licensed venues is out of line with other countries. My work did not require this and none of my conclusions depend on any assumptions or inputs relating to these, otherwise very interesting, comparisons.But even if there are such differentials, to suggest that price of drink is high in the nightclubs (in absolute terms or in relative terms, compared to elsewhere) due to 'greed' of the nightclubs owners is simplistic. My report supplies evidence to show that, at least in part, the cost of drink in the nightclubs is driven by external factors other than 'greed':The bottom line is - over 50% of what we pay in a nightclub for a drink has absolutely nothing to do with the nightclub owner's profit line. The above points - all clearly identified in the report - suggest that the cost of drink to the punter might be driven by the greed and/or other considerations of the Exchequer.Once again, Liam is correct, this is not a report written from a punter's perspective. As much as I would have loved to work on such an exciting topic of research, limitations of time, resources and brief require that this research be postponed for the future. Economics, like legal profession, is a field of professional inquiry and this means that one works within a given brief.However, I see no evidence to suggest at this moment in time that the industry I describe in the report is driven by some exceptional greed or short-termist pricing policies that are killing the groove.If anything, there is evidence in the report to show that the opposite is true. For example, the proposals for nightclub permit set very strict and costly (to the owners) parameters for what constitutes a nightclub. This is not done because there is a pursuit of a groove-killing quick profit, but because the sector participants have recognised the need to explicitly focus on long-term sector development.The end result of these proposals would be to deliver better value for money for the punters and safer and more responsible entertainment from the social point of view. These are hardly the reforms a 'greedy' profit-stripping business owner would subscribe to.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Nightclubs industry report, INIA report",,
7938,3275513,consortiumnews.com,reliable,http://www.consortiumnews.com/2010/061610a.html,"Prudhoe Bay, BP's Other Ticking Bomb Nearly 5,000 miles from the oil-spill catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, BP and its culture of cost-cutting are contributing to another environmental mess in the Prudhoe Bay oil field on Alaska’s north shore, according to internal BP documents and more than a dozen employees interviewed over the past month. Email

Printer friendly After two serious oil spills and other mishaps at the remote site, the BP employees fingered a long list of safety issues that have not been adequately addressed, making the Prudhoe Bay oilfield vulnerable to a devastating accident that potentially could rival the havoc in the Gulf.



“The condition of the [Prudhoe Bay] field is a lot worse and in my opinion a lot more dangerous,” said Marc Kovac, who has worked for BP on Alaska’s North Slope for more than three decades. “We still have hundreds of miles of rotting pipe ready to break that needs to be replaced. We are totally unprepared for a large spill.”



Kovac, a mechanic and welder who is the steward of the United Steelworkers union local 4959, said a lot of employees share his feelings, but “don't want to risk their jobs for speaking out.” Kovac said he was willing to take the risk because BP has been slow to deal with the Prudhoe Bay problems and that “many lives are at stake.”



Some of the employees, speaking anonymously, said BP follows an “operate to failure” attitude. Kovac said that means BP Alaska avoids spending money on “upkeep” and instead runs the equipment until it breaks down.



Typical of this problem, the employees said, was an oil spill that was discovered on Nov. 29, 2009, when a BP Alaska employee performing a routine check discovered oil pouring out from a two-foot long gash on the bottom of a 25-year-old pipeline at BP’s Lisburne facility.



“The spill was from an 18-inch three-phase common line carrying a mixture of crude oil, produced water, and natural gas,” according to an incident report from the Alaska Department of Environment and Conservation’s (ADEC) Division of Spill and Response.



BP Alaska’s “preliminary estimate for the total volume of oily material released is 45,828 gallons (1,091 barrels),” the report said.



The circumstances behind the spill are now the subject of a criminal and civil investigation by the FBI, the Environmental Protection Agency and Alaska state authorities. BP blamed the rupture on ice plugs that built up inside the pipeline, which caused increased pressure and finally the rupture.



In a Jan. 27 letter to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, BP Alaska President John Minge said the “overpressure rupture” was the result of looping the 18-inch pipeline with a 24-inch one as a way of minimizing “backpressure in the individual pipelines.”



“The two critical factors that led to the overpressure rupture of the pipeline were this looped configuration in combination with inadequate temperature monitoring locations” that were “physically located on the pipelines” inside the production facility “and not outside,” according to Minge’s letter to Murkowski. Criticism of BP



A person who works closely with BP and reviewed the letter said it “presents the specific facts of the event,” but does not contain the necessary context.



“When he indicates that the temperature sensors were located inside the buildings - obviously this shows a lack of attention to monitoring the pipelines,” said this person, who requested anonymity. “It is not just a mistake in placement of the monitors. The letter shows that they knew the line had a low flow rate and would go to the path of least resistance.



“Therefore, knowing that this field is located well above the Arctic Circle - you don't need a temperature sensor to know that by early November there will be sub-zero temperatures in place. So, a basic risk assessment should have identified this possibility well before you needed a temperature sensor to tell you what the temperature in the line would be.”



A top BP Prudhoe Bay official, who has grown “disillusioned” with the company’s management style over the past year, agreed.



“Someone was clearly not paying attention to the flow,” said the official, who also requested anonymity because he feared retaliation for discussing internal matters. “The temperature dropped and the line froze. This shouldn’t have happened. I equate this with a lack of operating discipline and place the blame squarely on leadership.”



Two weeks after the spill, a “red flag” e-mail was sent by BP’s Prudhoe Bay Operations Manager to officials and employees on the oilfield, reminding them to adhere “to established processes that ensure freeze prevention in flow lines, as well as, appropriate responses when freezing occurs.”



But other evidence suggests that poor management and cutbacks on safety may have contributed to the Lisburne oil spill. In January, an employee at Lisburne sent an e-mail to BP officials in Alaska saying the facility was “operating in [an] unsafe condition.” The employee, whose name was redacted, listed more than a dozen pieces of crucial production equipment that he said were not working or were out of service during the time of the spill, thus “leaving no back up to running equipment and equipment out of service which should be on-line as per the system requirements to run the plant.”



The employee warned that “with minimum manning in maintenance and operations we are basically running a broken plant with too few people to address the problems in a timely and safe manner. … “Operations can not rely on Management to provide them with a safe and reliable plant to work in. The management of our maintenance at [Lisburne Production Center] simply is not working to maintain a safe operation. This gap in maintenance management causes problems that increase the overall risk of plant integrity and personnel safety.” The e-mail claimed that some of the safety problems threatened the lives of workers. The employee cited “louvers” that he said fail to seal, an issue that has allegedly persisted for years. Louvers are connected to the production facility’s fire and gas suppression systems and are supposed to remain closed to trap a halon discharge in the event of fire or a gas buildup. Halon is a chemical that prevents explosions by depleting oxygen in the air.



“Simply put,” said one employee who works at Lisburne, “if those louvers don’t seal and there is a fire or gas is released people could die.” Imminent Danger



According to a top BP official who works on the North Slope and six Prudhoe Bay employees, BP’s fire and gas technical authorities told them it is likely that if BP were to test all of the louvers at North Slope facilities they would fail to seal, meaning the fire and gas suppression systems would be ineffective. That could put workers in imminent danger if there were a gas buildup, explosion or a fire.



Moreover, internal BP documents indicated that as of April 11, the louvers were not operating and would not be fixed for months. It’s unclear how the Gulf disaster, which occurred nine days later, will affect the pace of repairs at Prudhoe Bay. Steve Rinehart, a spokesman for BP Alaska, said the issues the employee addressed in the e-mail were dealt with immediately. ""We will not operate facilities unsafely,"" Rinehart said. ""We take this kind of info from employees very seriously. In this case, line leadership started meeting with the employees who raised these issues at Lisburne as soon as they received the list. We have made very good progress. Half the items have been closed out, some of the rest are virtually complete and all are being worked and tracked."" The Alaska State Fire Marshal, who would be responsible for inspecting the louvers and other fire and gas-related equipment to ensure it works properly, did not return a call for comment.



The employee’s e-mail, I was told by BP Alaska officials, is now in the hands of criminal investigators and BP’s probation officer, Mary Frances Barnes, who are scrutinizing the employee’s claims to determine if it had any bearing on the pipeline rupture last November and whether it would amount to a probation violation for the company. BP pleaded guilty in October 2007 to a criminal misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act, resulting from two oil spills on the North Slope in 2006, both of which resulted from severely corroded pipelines that the company failed to upkeep. The company was placed on probation for three years.



Tyler Amon is the special agent-in-charge at the EPA’s Criminal Investigation Division probing the circumstances behind last November’s oil spill. He did not return calls for comment nor did Barnes or a spokesperson for the FBI. The e-mail has also been sent to Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Waxman’s office did not return several calls for comment. An earlier congressional investigation found that deferral of maintenance projects contributed to other oil spills.



As of June 5, Lisburne was shut down for planned maintenance. It’s unknown if BP intends to address any of the maintenance and operational issues described in the e-mail.



Two BP management officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters, said budget cuts were largely the reason equipment was not upgraded or repaired and indicated that much of the problem has yet to be addressed. BP’s Alaska budget for 2010 is $$1 billion, compared with $$1.1 billion in 2009 and $$1.3 billion in 2008.



However, a document, which BP sent to the House Energy and Commerce Committee before the Gulf disaster, said budget cuts have not impacted projects that need to be funded at Prudhoe Bay. The company said the fear by employees that budget cuts would impact “integrity investment” was likely due to “dramatic changes in oil prices and economic uncertainty in late 2008 and continuing into 2009.”



“This perception was likely heightened by [BP Alaska’s] challenge to its contractors in early 2009 to deliver cost efficiencies,” said the budget document. “Our commitment is to activities that reduce risk – we target efficiency improvements to complete these activities at lower cost.”



The document indicates that BP deferred or “re-paced” some projects, but the company said it “risk-assessed each of the activities and identified mitigative measures to reduce any risk to safe operations.” Past Mistakes The pipeline rupture at Lisburne also may have been an example of BP Alaska failing to learn from its past mistakes. On Feb. 19, 2001, a pipeline ruptured under similar circumstances, with temperature monitors placed on the pipeline inside the building. BP told the State of Alaska and the ADEC that it would rectify the issue in the future by moving the monitors on all of its pipes outside of the facility so it could accurately check the temperature. But the company apparently never fulfilled its promise. Kovac and several other BP employees also raised red flags about a newly constructed – but what they consider a poorly designed – pipeline that feeds directly into pump station 1, the beginning of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. Replacing a portion of corroded pipeline that ruptured in 2006 and spilt more than 200,000 gallons of oil across the frozen tundra, the two-mile-long rebuilt pipeline has experienced “severe hopping up and down on the vertical support members,” due to wind induced vibration, a phenomenon that was discovered when the oilfield was developed more than 30 years ago. But it does not appear that BP learned that lesson of the past, either, when it designed the new pipeline. That “hopping,” Kovac said, has caused stress on the “pipewall” and weld joints on sections connected to the vertical support members. “The harmonics in [the pipeline] allowed it to bounce up and down,” Kovac said. “BP rectified the problem by placing timbers under the line between the vertical support members [which is not unusual] about two months ago. As far as I know, there isn’t a plan in place to [permanently] fix the problem.”



Kovac and other employees added that there are other corroded pipelines that should have been replaced three years ago, but haven’t been; plus, a spill-detection system hasn’t been installed.



Another contributing factor to the two most recent oil spills is the overworking of employees who face 16-18-hour work shifts because of a shortage of trained personnel. Internal company documents described the work situation as an “imminent safety risk” because employees who work more than 16 hours during a 24-hour time period can lack the mental capacity to make sound and timely decisions. Yet during 2009, 16-plus hour work shifts were routine at Prudhoe Bay, with employees working beyond 16 hours about 200-400 times per month, 75 percent of which represented 18-hour work shifts, according to internal BP documents.



Another internal BP document, dated Sept. 8, 2009, shows that one BP employee worked 36 consecutive days of 16 and 18 hour shifts in 2009 in violation of BP's own policies.



According to Jeanne Pascal, the EPA’s former debarment counsel who worked on BP-related matters for more than a decade, BP told her 10 years ago that the company intended to come up with a plan to “fix” the 16-18 hour work shifts.



BP employees who work at Prudhoe Bay are supposed to work 12-hour shifts for two weeks and then receive two weeks off. However, since employees who work beyond 12 hours receive overtime pay, some employees are “happy” to stay on the job beyond 12 hours because the pay is so good, Kovac said. “It’s not a good idea,” Kovac said. “Working more than 12 hours during a shift affects decision making and response time and can cause disasters. People have to take catnaps while operating large volumes of hydrocarbons under high pressure. We will have accidents as a result of it.”



BP has addressed the issue by hiring more technicians, but even that has not solved the problem as it takes three to four years, Kovac said, for a trainee to be fully prepared to work on the North Slope.



“The number of new technicians sent to the operating facilities since 2006 and the slower than expected pace of newly-hired technician training has not kept pace with ‘leavers,’ new work activities requiring substantial facility/field production technician support, and support for external commitments made and BP initiatives,” according to an October 2009 internal BP document explaining why 18-hour shifts continue despite their impact on the safe operations of Prudhoe Bay.



In 2009, there were 652 instances in which well-pad and drill-site operators worked in excess of 16 hours.



“Since well-pad operators are designated professional drivers, the scheduling represents a deliberate non-conformance to BP Group Standard for Driving Safety and [the BP Exploration Alaska] Driving Safety Policy,” said the October 2009 internal BP memo.



“Allowing the continuation of the 16-plus hour work shifts would be seen by internal and external stakeholders as putting production ahead of safety,” the document said.



Kovac and the other BP employees said they doubt that BP has the wherewithal to tackle the issues plaguing Prudhoe Bay. “This company seems incapable of managing its assets safely,” Kovac said – an observation that many Americans living along the Gulf of Mexico might consider an understatement.

If Everything Is So Great, How Come I’m Not Doing So Great?

September 12, 2016

While the view might be great from the top of the wealth/income pyramid, it takes a special kind of self-serving myopia to ignore the reality that the bottom 95% are not doing so well.

We're ceaselessly told/sold that the U.S. economy is doing phenomenally well in our current slow-growth world -- generating record corporate profits, record highs in the S&P 500 stock index, and historically low unemployment (4.9% in July 2016).

While GDP growth is somewhat lackluster by historical standards—less than 2% in 2016—it's growth nonetheless. And the rate of consumer-price inflation is hovering around 1%; negligible by historical standards.

But this uniformly positive statistical view of the U.S. economy raises a question among those not in the top 0.1%: If everything’s going so great, how come I’m not?

Whether it's struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living, a 0% return on savings, working longer hours while real wages stagnate, scrimping to pay back education loans, despairing at the abuses of power in our banking and political systems, or lamenting the loss of nourishing social interaction in our increasingly isolated and digital lifestyle — most ""regular"" people find their own personal experiences to be at odds with the rosy ""Everything is awesome!"" narrative trumpeted by our media.

The Scorecard

To get a more concrete understanding of this gap, let's establish a scorecard we can individually fill in to make an assessment of just how well we’re doing.

The key point about such a scorecard is this: We can only optimize what we measure. If we don’t measure (for example) leisure time and well-being in our assessment of Are we doing better than we were 10 years ago? then those issues simply aren’t considered.

And this is the flaw in using broad, easily-fudged statistics such as the unemployment rate as the primary measures of how great we’re doing (or not). What actually matters in life—our experiences, our stress level, our leisure time, our well-being and our sense of security, to name a few—is completely ignored by statistics such as GDP and unemployment.

I propose that a more accurate assessment requires responding to this list: Are you better off than you were 10 years ago in 2007, and 16 years ago in 2000?

1. Has the purchasing power of my earnings increased or declined since 2007 and 2000? That is, do my monthly earnings buy more healthcare insurance, college tuition, shelter and other goods and services than they did 10 and 16 years ago?

Here are a few charts to help you answer accurately:

These charts make it clear that real income (i.e. purchasing power) has declined markedly while big-ticket costs such as healthcare have skyrocketed for the majority of American households.

2. Is the quantity of packaged goods you buy now the same or less than in 2007 and 2000? That is, does the package that once contained 16 ounces now contain 14 ounces or even less?

3.Has the quality of goods and services you purchase now better or worse than the quality you received for the same share of your earnings 10 and 16 years ago? Do appliances last as long as they did then, or do they last longer? Do electronic devices last longer than they did in the past? How about furniture, clothing, etc.?

4. Does your children’s education better prepare them for a fast-changing economy now compared to 10/16 years ago?

5. How much shadow-work (to use Catherine Austin Fitts’ apt phrase) do you have to do now compared to 10/16 years ago? By shadow-work we mean work that was once done by businesses or the government that you must now perform yourself: pump your own gas, etc.

6. How much time do you now spend trying to fix administrative errors and things that are broken: incorrect billing, computer patches that don’t fix the problem, etc.?

7. Is your overall health and well-being better than it was 10/16 years ago, or worse? (Of course we have to allow for the advance of age, but the question is about how you feel and whether you now must deal with chronic diseases, pain management, etc. that you didn’t have 10 years ago.)

8. Is the quality of your healthcare better or worse than 10/16 years ago, in terms of cost, waiting time, co-pays, accuracy of diagnoses, ability to book an appointment in the near future, etc.?

9. Is your local infrastructure better or worse than it was 10/16 years ago? Are the roads better maintained, the trains and buses cleaner, the service personnel friendlier and more helpful?

10. Are your local government services more or less costly than they were 10/16 years? Have fees for water utilities, garbage pickup, license renewals, parking tickets, etc. gone up about 1% or 2% annually, in line with official inflation, or have they leaped by 5% or more year after year?

11. Are you receiving more government services for your increased property taxes? If so, precisely what services have been improved/added as a result of your paying higher property taxes?

12. Do you feel the safety and security of your neighborhood has increased or decreased? Do you safer walking home at midnight or less safe compared to 10/16 years ago?

13. Have the odds of a secure retirement with an income that will easily keep up with real-world inflation (around 7% annually) increased or decreased compared to 2007/2000?

14. Has your income on retirement money—IRAs, etc.--in bonds and savings accounts risen or declined?

15. Do you have more leisure time or less leisure time than 10/16 years ago? (Subtract the time spent on social media.) 16. Do you have more vacation time, and more money set aside to actually take a vacation with your family compared to 10/16 years ago? 17. Are you sleeping more or less than 10/16 years ago? (Sleep is a good indicator of health—poor sleep is highly correlated with poor health and chronic diseases.) 18. If you liquidated your stock holdings and retirement funds invested in stocks, are you wealthier (adjusted for inflation) than you were in 2000 and 2007? 19. Have you been able to save more annually now than you could 10/16 years ago? 20. Has your household debt load (student loans, mortgages, vehicle loans, consumer debt, etc.) increased or decreased since 2000 and 2007? 21. If your equity in real estate, stocks and bonds has increased, what (if any) improvements to the household did you fund with this “wealth effect”? 22. In terms of income, equity and exposure to risk, are you more financially secure or less financially secure than 10/16 years ago? 23. If you are more secure financially, how much of this financially security is the result of family gifts or an inheritance? How much is the result of higher real earnings? How much is the result of rising equity in real estate, stocks and bonds? 24. Do you feel more or less stress due to overwork, time pressure, financial worries, etc. compared to 10/16 years ago? 25. Are the people you associate with—colleagues, friends, neighbors, extended family members—experiencing higher levels of stress due to health crises, financial insecurity, overwork, etc., or are they generally experiencing less stress and chronic anxiety? 26. Do you have more time and money to invest in self-care (enrichment classes, concerts, fitness, hobbies etc.) or less time/more time for free-ranging, leisurely conversations with friends? 27. Is housing more affordable (to rent or buy) or less affordable than it was in 2007 and 2000? 28. Do you have more close friends or fewer close friends than you did 10/16 years ago? (A close friend is defined as someone who is always welcome to sleep in your guest room or on your sofa, someone with whom you can speak openly and truthfully about difficult emotional/financial issues.) 29. Do you feel your prospects—for greater financial security, higher earnings, career advancements, personal well-being, health, fitness and ability to help family and friends—are better or worse compared to 2000 and 2007? 30. Do you feel the prospects of your children and grandchildren are brighter or dimmer compared to 2007 and 2000?

If you're healthier, wealthier, more secure, have more leisure, more disposable income, less debt, a wider circle of intimate friends and are confident the future holds better prospects than it did 10/16 years ago, then — Congratulations!—you're doing great. And if you're still in the work force, you’re in the top 5% of American households:

Alternatively, if you’re retired with multiple ample pensions and/or you sold the modest home you bought decades ago for $$100,000 for $$1,000,000 or more, and you live in an upscale neighborhood, then you very likely feel that life is good and the future is bright.

This sort of security puts you in the top 10% of the nation’s households.

If you paid off the mortgage, have decent healthcare insurance and live in a place where services are available and affordable and you have a secure income, then you probably feel things are going well, too. This puts you in the top 20%.

But as many of you know from personal experience, a great many people who appear to “have it all” are struggling with financial crises, health crises, chronic stress due to financial insecurity, etc.

Some relatively modest percentage of American households are doing great—the thin slice that owns most of the nation’s wealth and thus has benefited from rising real estate, stock and bond prices. Another modest slice is doing well because they have secure positions in academia or the government, or if retired, draw ample pensions and healthcare benefits and have paid off their mortgage. A tiny slice has become multi-millionaires in the latest tech boom.

While the view might be great from the top of the wealth/income pyramid, it takes a special kind of self-serving myopia to ignore the reality that the bottom 95% are not doing so well.

In Part 2: The Keys To Prosperity, we provide guidance on strategies for how those 80-95% of us can position our efforts, our capital, and our mindsets in order to make the major macro trends in play work to our favor, and secure a prosperous future.

What If We're in a Depression But Don't Know It?

September 23, 2016

If it isn't a Depression, it's a very close relative of a Depression.

Just for the sake of argument, let's ask: what if we're in a Depression but don't know it? How could we possibly be in a Depression and not know it, you ask? Well, there are several ways we could be in a Depression and not know it:

1. The official statistics for ""growth"" (GDP), inflation, unemployment, and household income/ wealth have been engineered to mask the reality

2. The top 5% of households that dominate government, Corporate America, finance, the Deep State and the media have been doing extraordinarily well during the past eight years of stock market bubble (oops, I mean boom) and ""recovery,"" and so they report that the economy is doing splendidly because they've done splendidly.

I have explained exactly how official metrics are engineered to reflect a rosy picture that is far from reality.:

What's the Real Unemployment Rate? That's the Wrong Question September 14, 2016

Fun with Fake Statistics: The 5% ""Increase"" in Median Household Income Is Pure Illusion September 19, 2016

Here's Why Wages Have Stagnated--and Will Continue to Stagnate August 15, 2016

Could Inflation Break the Back of the Status Quo? August 5, 2016

What Happens When Rampant Asset Inflation Ends? August 4, 2016

Revealing the Real Rate of Inflation Would Crash the System August 3, 2016

Inflation Hidden in Plain Sight

I also also asked a series of questions that sought experiential evidence rather than easily gamed statistics for the notion that this ""recovery"" is more like a recession or Depression than an actual expansion:

If Everything Is So Great, How Come I’m Not Doing So Great? September 12, 2016

Rather than accept official assurances that we're in the eighth year of a ""recovery,"" let's look at a few charts and reach our own conclusion. Let's start with the civilian labor force participation rate--the percentage of the civilian work force that is employed (realizing that many of the jobs are low-paying gigs or part-time work).

Does the participation rate today look anything like the dot-com boom that actually raised almost everyone's boat at least a bit? Short answer: No., it doesn't. Today's labor force participation rate is a complete catastrophe that can only be described by one word: Depression.

Wages as a percentage of GDP has been in a 45-year freefall that can only be described as Depression for wage earners:

Notice what happened when the Federal Reserve started blowing serial asset bubbles in 2000: GDP went up but wages went down. Is this a recession or depression? It's your call, but if you're the recipient of the stagnating wages, it's depressing.

Meanwhile, the top 5% who own most of the assets that have been bubbling higher have been doing great. The Depression is only a phenomenon of the bottom 95%:

Look at the rocket ship of corporate profits. What happened around 2001 to send corporate profits on a rocket ride higher? The Fed happened, that's what:

Here's the Fed balance sheet: to the moon!

Free money for financiers and corporations fueled the stock market buyback boom:

Which fueled the stock market bubble:

Is the economy in a Depression? Not if you're a corporate bigwig skimming vast gains from corporate buybacks funded by the Fed's free money for financiers.

But if you're a wage earner who's seen your pay, hours and benefits cut while your healthcare costs have skyrocketed--well, if it isn't a Depression, it's a very close relative of a Depression.

7941,3275516,oftwominds.com,bias,http://www.oftwominds.com/blogmay14/unaffordable5-14.html,"The truth is painfully obvious: a middle class lifestyle is unaffordable to all but the top 20%. This reality is destabilizing to the current arrangement, i.e. debt-based consumerism a.k.a. neofeudal state-cartel capitalism, so it is actively suppressed by the officially sanctioned narrative: that middle class status is attainable by almost every household with two earners (a mere $$50,000 annual household income makes one middle class) and middle class wealth is increasing.

It's not that difficult to define a middle class lifestyle: just list what was taken for granted in the postwar era of widespread prosperity circa the 1960s, four decades ago.

In What Does It Take To Be Middle Class? (December 5, 2013), I listed 10 basic ""threshold"" attributes and two somewhat higher thresholds for membership in the middle class:

1. Meaningful healthcare insurance (i.e. not phantom ""insurance"" with deductibles that cost thousands of dollars a year that offers no non-catastrophic care at all)

2. Significant equity (25%-50%) in a home

3. Income/expenses that enable the household to save at least 6% of its income

4. Significant retirement funds: 401Ks, IRAs, etc.

5. The ability to service all debt and expenses over the medium-term if one of the primary household wage-earners lose their job

6. Reliable vehicles for each wage-earner

7. The household does not rely on government transfers to maintain its lifestyle

8. Non-paper, non-real estate assets such as family heirlooms, precious metals, tools, etc. that can be transferred to the next generation, i.e. generational wealth

9. Ability to invest in offspring (education, extracurricular clubs/training, etc.)

10. Leisure time devoted to the maintenance of physical/spiritual/mental fitness

The higher thresholds:

11. Continual accumulation of human and social capital (new skills, markets for one's services, etc.)

And the money shot:

12. Family ownership of income-producing assets such as rental properties, bonds, etc.

The key point of these thresholds is that propping up a precarious illusion of consumption and status signifiers does not qualify as middle class. To qualify as middle class, the household must actually own/control wealth that won't vanish if the investment bubble du jour pops, and won't be wiped out by a layoff, college costs or a medical emergency.

In Chris Sullin's phrase, ""They should be focusing resources on the next generation and passing on Generational Wealth"" as opposed to ""keeping up appearances"" via aspirational consumption financed with debt.

I then added up the real cost of these minimum thresholds and arrived at a minimum of $$106,000 annual household income--double the median household income in the U.S. According to Census Bureau data, only the top 20% earn this level of income.

Here is a chart of the real income of the lower 90% and the top 10%, which by definition cannot be ""middle class"":

The top 10% takes home 51% of all household income:

This suggests that the ""middle class"" has atrophied into the 10% of households just below the top 10%. Households in the ""bottom 80%"" are lacking essential attributes of a middle class lifestyle that were once affordable on a much more modest income.

Note that this $$100,000+ household income has no budget for college costs, lavish vacations, boats, weekends spent skiing, etc., nor does it budget for luxury vehicles, SUVs, oversized pickup trucks or private schooling. Savings are modest, along with living expenses and retirement contributions. This is a barebones middle class budget.

So how have we maintained an increasingly unaffordable lifestyle? With debt: Wages have risen modestly while debt has increased enormously.

As I have described many times, the Federal Reserve's ""solution"" to the widening gap between income and expenses was to financialize the middle class's primary asset: the home. I have explained this in depth: The Fed's Solution to Income Stagnation: Make Everyone a Speculator (January 24, 2014)

Fed to the Sharks, Part 2: Housing and the Death of the Middle Class (April 9, 2014)

But turning everyone into a speculator via financialization had an unintended consequence: widening wealth inequality. It turns out most people are poor speculators, believing ""this time it's different"" again and again. In addition, financialization favors those with the most capital: this is the essential take-away from Thomas Piketty's book Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

The conclusion is inescapable: What's the Primary Cause of Wealth Inequality? Financialization (March 24, 2014).

As a consequence, net worth (i.e. ownership of assets and wealth) of middle income households has been reduced to a sliver:

The widening wealth gap cannot be entirely explained away as the result of some innate force of capitalism; the rich have gotten richer as the direct result of central state/central bank policies introduced since the heyday of the middle class forty years ago.

So where does this leave us? To answer that, we need to examine the systemic causes of the higher costs and reliance on speculative bubbles that have eaten the middle class alive. We'll address those tomorrow in Part 2.

Get a Job, Build a Real Career and Defy a Bewildering Economy (Kindle, $$9.95)(print, $$20)



Are you like me?

Ever since my first summer job decades ago, I've been chasing financial security. Not win-the-lottery, Bill Gates riches (although it would be nice!), but simply a feeling of financial control. I want my financial worries to if not disappear at least be manageable and comprehensible. And like most of you, the way I've moved toward my goal has always hinged not just on having a job but a career. You don't have to be a financial blogger to know that ""having a job"" and ""having a career"" do not mean the same thing today as they did when I first started swinging a hammer for a paycheck. Even the basic concept ""getting a job"" has changed so radically that jobs--getting and keeping them, and the perceived lack of them--is the number one financial topic among friends, family and for that matter, complete strangers. So I sat down and wrote this book: Get a Job, Build a Real Career and Defy a Bewildering Economy. It details everything I've verified about employment and the economy, and lays out an action plan to get you employed. I am proud of this book. It is the culmination of both my practical work experiences and my financial analysis, and it is a useful, practical, and clarifying read. Test drive the first section and see for yourself. Kindle, $$9.95 print, $$20 ""I want to thank you for creating your book Get a Job, Build a Real Career and Defy a Bewildering Economy. It is rare to find a person with a mind like yours, who can take a holistic systems view of things without being captured by specific perspectives or agendas. Your contribution to humanity is much appreciated.""

Could Inflation Break the Back of the Status Quo?

August 5, 2016

Political resistance to the oligarchy's financialization skimming operations will eventually cripple central bank giveaways to the financial sector and corporate oligarchs.

That inflation and interest rates will remain near-zero for a generation is accepted as ""obvious"" by virtually the entire mainstream media. The reasons for this are equally ""obvious"": central banks have the power to suppress interest rates indefinitely by creating money out of thin air and using this new cash to buy bonds in unlimited quantities; and the commoditization/ globalization of labor, capital and production has generated a global backdrop of over-capacity and near-zero pricing power.

But suppose for a moment that this confidence in near-zero interest rates and inflation as far as the eye can see is wrong. As I have demonstrated this week, rising interest rates and inflation would break the back of the status quo.

What makes inflation difficult to grasp is its multi-faceted character. Inflation is a monetary dynamic, to be sure, as creating new fiat currency in excess of increasing production / productivity reduces the purchasing power of the currency.

But as I have shown this week, inflation is also one result of cartel capitalism, in which politically powerful cartels can raise prices and reduce quantity and quality without fear of consumers going elsewhere because the cartels have effectively eliminated competition via regulatory capture, lobbying and the immense advantages of unlimited credit from central banks.

Inflation is also tied to the incentives for fraud in our system: lowering quality as a means of Inflation Hidden in Plain Sight increases profits at the expense of consumers who have few means to detect and measure the reduction in the value of what their money buys.

No Wrongdoing Here, Just 6,300 Corporate Fines and Settlements (May 2015)

Inflation is also the result of revenue-hungry governments which jack up junk fees, stealth taxes and outright taxes while delivering lower quality services.

As I have noted many times, inflationary forces are built into urbanization and modern systems of production. Socio-historian Immanuel Wallerstein listed three dynamics that raise costs while delivering little additional direct value to consumers:

1. Urbanization increases the cost of labor (a reality since the 1400s).

2. Externalized costs (dumping private waste into the Commons, environmental damage and depletion, etc.) eventually must be paid one way or another.

3. Rising taxes as governments responds to unlimited demands by citizens for more services (education, healthcare, etc.) and economic security (pensions, welfare).

Financialization also feeds inflation in a variety of subtle ways. The wealthy can keep abreast of real inflation via Asset Inflation while the bottom 95% struggle to pay higher prices for everything from burritos to healthcare.

Financiers and corporations with unlimited credit lines at near-zero rates can buy up rental housing and jack up rents, for example, while asset inflation has pushed housing out of reach of moderate-income households living in job-rich desirable areas.

Meanwhile, small businesses without access to unlimited credit at near-zero interest rates struggle to stay afloat as prices and overhead costs weigh ever more heavily:

So how could inflation rise despite near-universal faith that central banks can inflate credit and assets forever without triggering inflation? History suggests that rampant creation of fiat currency far in excess of increases in GDP eventually catches up with central planners. Consider this chart of inflation in Venezuela:

Another widely held truism holds that inflation cannot rise until wage inflation takes hold. Given the pressure of automation on human labor (and the rising costs of laboir-related overhead such as healthcare), the belief that labor costs will remain subdued makes sense.

But it isn't quite that simple. Ironically, as automation replaces lower-value labor, the work that cannot be automated becomes more valuable. Difficult-to-automate labor generally requires a high level of education and experience, and often requires working knowledge of multiple fields.

The number of workers with these skills is limited by these high hurdles. There might be 1,000 unemployed people seeking a job but only 200 possess the skillsets that are in demand. (THe Pareto Distribution--the 80/20 rule--suggests 20% of the workforce generates 80% of the productivity gains and profits.)

This is as true of skilled tradespeople as it is of high-level managers.

The net result of these trends is eventual wage inflation as employers who need these high-level skills will have to bid for the relatively few workers with the requisite skills.

Though it may appear counter-intuitive, these dynamics inevitably generate an economy in which low-skill labor is in over-supply and millions are unemployed because low-skill work is scarce and those able to perform the work are abundant, while those able to perform high-skill labor are scarce.

In this scenario, wages for the top 20% of the workforce rise due to supply-demand imbalances while wages for the lower-skill 80% rise due to political pressures such as we're seeing now with demands for higher minimum wages.

The imminent retirement of millions of experienced Baby Boomer workers will only exacerbate these wage inflation pressures.

Tens of millions of workers have removed themselves from the workforce or have been removed by restrictive disabled-benefits statutes. Millions more get by on welfare or welfare benefits supplemented with cash income earned in the burgeoning black market economy.

Last but certainly not least, political resistance to the oligarchy's financialization skimming operations will eventually cripple central bank giveaways to the financial sector and corporate oligarchs. There is no other honest word to describe central bank policies other than giveaway, as free money for financiers has greatly expanded wealth and income inequality and handed financiers and corporations essentially unlimited funds to expand cartels and buy political power.

The mainstream financial media is blind to the reality that finance is always political. The privileged few with access to unlimited central bank giveaways can profit in ways that are not available to the bottom 99.9%. Once the political winds of resistance to the oligarchy rise, central banks and the state agencies that enable the dominance of the financial oligarchy will face limits that did not exist in the years of bogus ""recovery"" (2009-2016).

Unprecedented expansion of credit, wage inflation and much-needed limits on the power of central banks to give away billions to oligarchs will generate inflation. The central planners have successfully masked real inflation behind a smokescreen of official statistics, but eventually a wind will rise that blows the smokescreen away, and the reality of rising inflation will break the back of the financial-political status quo.

Washington (dpo) - Donald Trump oder Hillary Clinton – bislang galt als sicher, dass einer dieser beiden Kandidaten nach der US-Präsidentschaftswahl im November ins Weiße Haus einzieht. Doch nun sorgt eine neue Umfrage für Turbulenzen, nach der ein an eine Mauer in Minnesota angelehnter Besen in der Wählergunst noch deutlich vor Trump und Clinton liegt.Laut der vom Fernsehsender ABC durchgeführten Umfrage, in der sich die Befragten zwischen Clinton, Trump und dem an eine weiße Hauswand gelehnten Besen entscheiden mussten, würden 47 Prozent der US-Bürger ihre Stimme dem namenlosen Besen geben, wenn heute gewählt würde. Clinton und Trump dürften dagegen nur auf 28 beziehungsweise 25 Prozent hoffen. Dabei sind die Fans des aus Eschenholz gefertigten Putzgeräts in allen Alters- und Bildungsschichten gleichermaßen stark vertreten.Was den Besenstiel, der über keine nennenswerte Kampagne verfügt, so viel beliebter macht als die anderen beiden Top-Kandidaten, ist noch nicht gänzlich erforscht. Gespräche mit potenziellen Wählern legen jedoch nahe, dass besonders seine zurückhaltende Art gut ankommt. ""Er hat nie irgendwelche dubiose Deals abgewickelt, gegen Minderheiten gehetzt oder Rüstungskonzerne gefördert"", schwärmt etwa Carl Williams aus Pittsburgh. ""Ich bin mir sicher, dass er unsere Straßen sauberhalten kann.

Unfortunately, his ""gloomy view"" is supported by such events as the record surge in gun violence and deadly shootings in Chicago, where the locals also do not ascribe to the WaPo's rosy take on events, and instead blame the economy and the lack of jobs for the ongoing social collapse in the windy city.

In any case, Trump dismissed concern that his comments, which the WaPo said ""are exceedingly unusual, if not unprecedented, for a major party front-runner"", which is precisely Trump's style, ""could potentially affect financial markets.""

“It’s irresponsible. It’s baffling that he would do this and also substantively wrong. There is no recession in sight.” -Doug Holtz-Eakin — Robert Costa (@costareports) April 2, 2016

As the WaPo adds, ""over the course of the discussion, the candidate made clear that he would govern in the same nontraditional way that he has campaigned, tossing aside decades of American policy and custom in favor of a new, Trumpian approach to the world.""

In his first 100 days, Trump said, he would cut taxes, “renegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals,” including altering the U.S. role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

This is what he said:

""I think we’re sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble... We’re not at 5 percent unemployment. We’re at a number that’s probably into the 20s if you look at the real number. That was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians – and in particular presidents – look good. And I wouldn’t be getting the kind of massive crowds that I’m getting if the number was a real number."" ""I’m talking about a bubble where you go into a very massive recession. Hopefully not worse than that, but a very massive recession. Look, we have money that’s so cheap right now. And if I want to borrow money, I can borrow all the money I want. But I’m rich... If somebody is a great, wonderful person, going to employ lots of people, a really talented businessperson, wants to borrow money, but they’re not rich? They have no chance... Is it a good time to invest now? ""Oh, I think it’s a terrible time right now... because the dollar's so strong... You have – think of it – you have cheap money that nobody can get unless you’re rich. You have the regulators are running the banks. Not the guys that are being paid $$50 million a year to run the banks. I mean, when you look at many of your friends that are running banks that are being paid $$40 and $$50 million, yeah, they’re not running the banks. The regulators are running the banks. You have a situation where you have an inflated stock market. It started to deflate, but then it went back up again. Usually that’s a bad sign. That’s a sign of things to come."" ""Part of the reason it’s precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends. Nobody’s ever going to stop it. And the reason they’re not going to stop it is one of two. They’re either living in a world of the make-believe, or they’re totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests. Meaning people that want it to continue. Because what China, what Mexico, what Japan – I don’t want to name too many countries, because I actually do business in a lot of these countries – but what these countries are doing to us is unbelievable. They are draining our jobs. They are draining our money."" ""I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly...I would do a tax cut. You have to do a tax cut. Because we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. But I would start...I would immediately start renegotiating our trade deals with Mexico, China, Japan and all of these countries that are just absolutely destroying us. ""

Below are some of the annotated highlights of his bearish take on the economy via the WaPo.

Trump has for months contended that the U.S. economy is in trouble because of what he sees as an overvalued stock market, but his view has grown more pessimistic of late and he is now bearish on investing, to the point of warning Americans against doing so. “I think we’re sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble,” Trump said. He made clear that he was not specifying a sector of the economy but the economy at large and asserted that more bullish forecasts were based on skewed employment numbers and an inflated stock market. ""First of all, we’re not at 5 percent unemployment. We’re at a number that’s probably into the twenties if you look at the real number,” Trump said. “That was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians — and, in particular, presidents — look good. And I wouldn’t be getting the kind of massive crowds that I’m getting if the number was a real number.” Trump said, “it’s precarious times. Part of the reason it’s precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends. Nobody’s ever going to stop it. And the reason they’re not going to stop it is one of two. They’re either living in a world of the make-believe, or they’re totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests.” “I’m pessimistic,” Trump said. “Unless changes are made. Changes could be made.” By Trump, for instance: “I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly.” Trump firmly believes that a turnaround on trade would be the necessary beginning of a solution to any looming recession. He mentions the Trans-Pacific Partnership as one pact he would immediately seek to renegotiate, putting him at odds with congressional Republicans who supported giving the president fast-track trade authority last year. Coupled with his push on trade would be a “very big tax cut,” which Trump unveiled last September. That proposal increases taxes on the “very rich” but reduces taxes for most taxpayers and would cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. To woo companies back to the United States, he would offer an incentive of a deeply discounted rate and would no longer allow corporations to defer taxes on income earned overseas.

* * *

The Washington Post was displeased by Trump’s pessimistic view, which it said ""runs counter to that of most economists, whose rough consensus is that the U.S. economy has about a 20 percent chance of slipping into recession this year largely because growth remains weak across the world, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists in March.""

Most economists aren’t overly worried about an imminent downturn because job creation remains strong, workers are starting to see their wages grow and the Federal Reserve remains cautious about shifting away from the low-interest-rate stance that has helped stimulate the economy.

Cheerful economists promptly chimed in to defend the economy:

“It’s irresponsible. It’s baffling that he would do this and also substantively wrong. There is no recession in sight.” -Doug Holtz-Eakin — Robert Costa (@costareports) April 2, 2016

Of course, whether Trump is right or not with his warning about the economy and the market, only time will tell, although as we reported in mid-January, Trump is certainly hoping for a market crash. The reason is that historically, the market performance in the three months leading up to a Presidential Election has displayed an uncanny ability to forecast who will win the White House… the incumbent party or the challenger. Since 1928, there have been 22 Presidential Elections. In 14 of them, the S&P 500 climbed during the three months preceding election day. The incumbent President or party won in 12 of those 14 instances. However, in 7 of the 8 elections where the S&P 500 fell over that three month period, the incumbent party lost.

In other words, if Trump wants to win he would certainly benefit from a major drop in the S&P in the all important September to November period. That is, assuming he gets the nomination.

* * *

Of note also was Trump's insistence that he would be able to get rid of the nation’s more than $$19 trillion national debt: ""We’re not a rich country. We’re a debtor nation. We’ve got to get rid of – I talked about bubble. We’ve got to get rid of the $$19 trillion in debt."" How long would that take? ""Well, I would say over a period of eight years.""

This is how he says he would do it: ""I’m renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we’re doing so badly on. With China, $$505 billion this year in trade.” He said that economic growth he foresees as a consequence of renegotiated deals would enable the United States to pay down the debt.

But Trump's most interesting comment had nothing to do with economics - it was his admission that everyone close to him — family, friends, Republican leaders — have been urging him to tone down his attacks and reach out to former rivals, both to reassure wary voters and to begin the difficult process of unifying a party in which many have sworn to never back him. Trump does not intend to take the advice. He said such overtures are ""overrated."" ""I think the first thing I have to do is win,"" he said. ""Winning solves a lot of problems. And I have two people left"": his two remaining Republican rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

As millions of Americans struggle to decide whether to elect a volatile narcissist or a calculated warmongering criminal as their next leader, one Minnesota town is doing politics right - they just re-elected a dog to his third term as mayor.

Duke, a nine-year-old Great Pyrenees, was first elected mayor of Cormorant, Minnesota in 2014. The first time he won, it was by accident. The small town of just over 1,000 people held an election in which residents could pay $$1 to vote. Duke won the race with twelve write-in votes and was treated to an official inauguration.

The town’s voters were evidently happy with the 2014 fluke. Duke has been re-elected twice, most recently at the end of August.

His main role has been to promote a sense of community in the township. He was recently featured in a series of billboards promoting Cormorant.

“I don’t know who would run against him, because he’s done such great things for the community,” Karen Nelson, a resident of Cormorant told local ABC affiliate WDAY, before the election. “Everybody voted for Duke, except for one vote for his girlfriend, Lassie,” Duke’s owner David Rick said after Duke won.

Though Duke’s re-election is particularly comical in an election year rife with unpopular candidates and marred by animosity, derision, and deceit, the town’s decision to elect and keep a dog in office has profound implications.

Though over 1,000 people live in Cormorant, only twelve decided to elect Duke in 2014. Similarly, Anti-Media recently explained that only 9 percent of the voting public chose either Trump or Clinton in the primary elections this year.

This is an ongoing pattern:

“In the 2012 election, President Obama was elected with 51.1 percent of the popular vote, compared to 47.2 for Mitt Romney. But only 57.5 percent of the voting population cast their ballots, meaning President Obama still only secured the votes of 29 percent of voters.”

The same staggeringly low voter turnout that plagues national politics presented itself in Cormorant. But the consequences of having a dog serve as mayor are far less severe than allowing a small segment of the national population to decide which criminal politicians will rule over the rest of the country. Presidential and national politics represent a wholly unrepresentative political process in which the few decide for the many in more ways than one, and Cormorant reflects these deeper flaws in American elections.

More important, Cormorant demonstrates that a non-human can run a town of over one thousand people without the community deteriorating into chaos. While humans support Duke’s administration, the fact the town has continued to function and thrive with a dog in a position of leadership highlights just how little guidance humans actually need — especially considering how consistently politicians have flagrantly ignored the concerns and well-being of their constituents.

Though politicians and the media repeatedly paint the picture that the nation’s fate hangs in the balance of any given election, Duke’s success provides a valuable counter-narrative. And though a small town of 1,000 people is hardly a sufficient anecdote to debunk centuries worth of American “democracy,” Duke’s case is far from the only one.

A cat named Stubbs currently presides over Talkeetna, Alaska. April the cow served as mayor of Eastsound, Washington from 2011 to 2012. A beer-drinking goat named Clay Henry III served as mayor of Lajitas, Texas until 1992. “Best mayor we ever had,” Davis Odom, a local historian, said. Henry III was succeeded by two more goat mayors. As the Wall Street Journal detailed:

“In Rabbit Hash, Ky., a Border Collie named Lucy Lou defeated 10 dogs, a cat, a possum, a jackass and even one human to become the town’s third animal mayor—all dogs—since 1998, says Bobbi Kayser, the current mayor’s owner.”

If individuals can govern themselves at the local level, who’s to say they wouldn’t survive without a leader at the top of the political hierarchy? People across the country are already taking it upon themselves to better their communities without the help of government and their ‘leaders.’ Between using apps that distribute food to the homeless, establishing community gardens and wifi, and taking it upon themselves to pick up their governments’ slack, Americans are learning to rely on themselves rather than their leaders, proving that without government, people make the world go ‘round.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"A Dog Is Re-Elected Mayor For A Third Term, Proving Politicians Are Useless",,,"['Zero Hedge', 'Zerohedge', 'Finance', 'Economics', 'Markets', 'Politics', 'Analysis', 'President Obama', 'Wall Street Journal']","As millions of Americans struggle to decide whether to elect a volatile narcissist or a calculated warmongering criminal as their next leader, one Minnesota town is doing politics right - they just re-elected a dog to his third term as mayor.","Wall Street Journal, President Obama",,

7955,3275536,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/06/the-four-reasons-the-mainstream-media-is-worthless.html,"There are four reasons that the mainstream media is worthless.

1. Self-Censorship by Journalists

Initially, there is tremendous self-censorship by journalists.

For example, several months after 9/11, famed news anchor Dan Rather told the BBC that American reporters were practicing “a form of self-censorship”:



“there was a time in South Africa that people would put flaming tires around peoples’ necks if they dissented. And in some ways the fear is that you will be necklaced here, you will have a flaming tire of lack of patriotism put around your neck. Now it is that fear that keeps journalists from asking the toughest of the tough questions…. And again, I am humbled to say, I do not except myself from this criticism. “What we are talking about here – whether one wants to recognise it or not, or call it by its proper name or not – is a form of self-censorship.”

Keith Olbermann agreed that there is self-censorship in the American media, and that:

“You can rock the boat, but you can never say that the entire ocean is in trouble …. You cannot say: By the way, there’s something wrong with our …. system”.

As former Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin wrote in 2006:

Mainstream-media political journalism is in danger of becoming increasingly irrelevant, but not because of the Internet, or even Comedy Central. The threat comes from inside. It comes from journalists being afraid to do what journalists were put on this green earth to do. . . . There’s the intense pressure to maintain access to insider sources, even as those sources become ridiculously unrevealing and oversensitive. There’s the fear of being labeled partisan if one’s bullshit-calling isn’t meted out in precisely equal increments along the political spectrum. If mainstream-media political journalists don’t start calling bullshit more often, then we do risk losing our primacy — if not to the comedians then to the bloggers. I still believe that no one is fundamentally more capable of first-rate bullshit-calling than a well-informed beat reporter – whatever their beat. We just need to get the editors, or the corporate culture, or the self-censorship – or whatever it is – out of the way.

And Air Force Colonel and key Pentagon official Karen Kwiatkowski wrote:

I have been told by reporters that they will not report their own insights or contrary evaluations of the official 9/11 story, because to question the government story about 9/11 is to question the very foundations of our entire modern belief system regarding our government, our country, and our way of life. To be charged with questioning these foundations is far more serious than being labeled a disgruntled conspiracy nut or anti-government traitor, or even being sidelined or marginalized within an academic, government service, or literary career. To question the official 9/11 story is simply and fundamentally revolutionary. In this way, of course, questioning the official story is also simply and fundamentally American.

(page 26).

2. Censorship by Higher-Ups

If journalists do want to speak out about an issue, they also are subject to tremendous pressure by their editors or producers to kill the story.



The Pulitzer prize-winning reporter who uncovered the Iraq prison torture scandal and the Mai Lai massacre in Vietnam, Seymour Hersh, said:



“All of the institutions we thought would protect us — particularly the press, but also the military, the bureaucracy, the Congress — they have failed. The courts . . . the jury’s not in yet on the courts. So all the things that we expect would normally carry us through didn’t. The biggest failure, I would argue, is the press, because that’s the most glaring…. Q: What can be done to fix the (media) situation? [Long pause] You’d have to fire or execute ninety percent of the editors and executives. You’d actually have to start promoting people from the newsrooms to be editors who you didn’t think you could control. And they’re not going to do that.”

In fact many journalists are warning that the true story is not being reported. See this announcement and this talk.

And a series of interviews with award-winning journalists also documents censorship of certain stories by media editors and owners (and see these samples).

There are many reasons for censorship by media higher-ups.

One is money.

The media has a strong monetary interest to avoid controversial topics in general. It has always been true that advertisers discourage stories which challenge corporate power. Indeed, a 2003 survey reveals that 35% of reporters and news executives themselves admitted that journalists avoid newsworthy stories if “the story would be embarrassing or damaging to the financial interests of a news organization’s owners or parent company.”

In addition, the government has allowed tremendous consolidation in ownership of the airwaves during the past decade. The large media players stand to gain billions of dollars in profits if the Obama administration continues to allow monopoly ownership of the airwaves by a handful of players. The media giants know who butters their bread. So there is a spoken or tacit agreement: if the media cover the administration in a favorable light, the MSM will continue to be the receiver of the government’s goodies.

3. Drumming Up Support for War

In addition, the owners of American media companies have long actively played a part in drumming up support for war.

It is painfully obvious that the large news outlets studiously avoided any real criticism of the government’s claims in the run up to the Iraq war. It is painfully obvious that the large American media companies acted as lapdogs and stenographers for the government’s war agenda.

Veteran reporter Bill Moyers criticized the corporate media for parroting the obviously false link between 9/11 and Iraq (and the false claims that Iraq possessed WMDs) which the administration made in the run up to the Iraq war, and concluded that the false information was not challenged because:

“the [mainstream] media had been cheerleaders for the White House from the beginning and were simply continuing to rally the public behind the President — no questions asked.”

And as NBC News’ David Gregory (later promoted to host Meet the Press) said:

“I think there are a lot of critics who think that . . . . if we did not stand up [in the run-up to the war] and say ‘this is bogus, and you’re a liar, and why are you doing this,’ that we didn’t do our job. I respectfully disagree. It’s not our role”

But this is nothing new. In fact, the large media companies have drummed up support for all previous wars.

For example, Hearst helped drum up support for the Spanish-American War.

And an official summary of America’s overthrow of the democratically-elected president of Iran in the 1950’s states, “In cooperation with the Department of State, CIA had several articles planted in major American newspapers and magazines which, when reproduced in Iran, had the desired psychological effect in Iran and contributed to the war of nerves against Mossadeq.” (page x)

The mainstream media also may have played footsie with the U.S. government right before Pearl Harbor. Specifically, a highly-praised historian (Bob Stineet) argues that the Army’s Chief of Staff informed the Washington bureau chiefs of the major newspapers and magazines of the impending Pearl Harbor attack BEFORE IT OCCURRED, and swore them to an oath of secrecy, which the media honored (page 361) .

And the military-media alliance has continued without a break (as a highly-respected journalist says, “viewers may be taken aback to see the grotesque extent to which US presidents and American news media have jointly shouldered key propaganda chores for war launches during the last five decades.”)

As the mainstream British paper, the Independent, writes:

There is a concerted strategy to manipulate global perception. And the mass media are operating as its compliant assistants, failing both to resist it and to expose it. The sheer ease with which this machinery has been able to do its work reflects a creeping structural weakness which now afflicts the production of our news.

The article in the Independent discusses the use of “black propaganda” by the U.S. government, which is then parroted by the media without analysis; for example, the government forged a letter from al Zarqawi to the “inner circle” of al-Qa’ida’s leadership, urging them to accept that the best way to beat US forces in Iraq was effectively to start a civil war, which was then publicized without question by the media..

So why has the American press has consistenly served the elites in disseminating their false justifications for war?

One of of the reasons is because the large media companies are owned by those who support the militarist agenda or even directly profit from war and terror (for example, NBC is owned by General Electric, one of the largest defense contractors in the world — which directly profits from war, terrorism and chaos).

Another seems to be an unspoken rule that the media will not criticize the government’s imperial war agenda.

And the media support isn’t just for war: it is also for various other shenanigans by the powerful. For example, a BBC documentarysdocuments:

There was “a planned coup in the USA in 1933 by a group of right-wing American businessmen . . . . The coup was aimed at toppling President Franklin D Roosevelt with the help of half-a-million war veterans. The plotters, who were alleged to involve some of the most famous families in America, (owners of Heinz, Birds Eye, Goodtea, Maxwell Hse & George Bush’s Grandfather, Prescott) believed that their country should adopt the policies of Hitler and Mussolini to beat the great depression.”

Moreover, “the tycoons told the general who they asked to carry out the coup that the American people would accept the new government because they controlled all the newspapers.“ See also this book.

Have you ever heard of this scheme before? It was certainly a very large one. And if the conspirators controlled the newspapers then, how much worse is it today with media consolidation?

4. Censorship by the Government

Finally, as if the media’s own interest in promoting war is not strong enough, the government has exerted tremendous pressure on the media to report things a certain way. Indeed, at times the government has thrown media owners and reporters in jail if they’ve been too critical. The media companies have felt great pressure from the government to kill any real questioning of the endless wars.

For example, Dan Rather said, regarding American media, “What you have is a miniature version of what you have in totalitarian states”.

Tom Brokaw said “all wars are based on propaganda.

And the head of CNN said:

Indeed, former military analyst and famed Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg said that the government has ordered the media not to cover 9/11:



Ellsberg seemed hardly surprised that today’s American mainstream broadcast media has so far failed to take [former FBI translator and 9/11 whistleblower Sibel] Edmonds up on her offer, despite the blockbuster nature of her allegations [which Ellsberg calls “far more explosive than the Pentagon Papers”]. As Edmonds has also alluded, Ellsberg pointed to the New York Times, who “sat on the NSA spying story for over a year” when they “could have put it out before the 2004 election, which might have changed the outcome.” “There will be phone calls going out to the media saying ‘don’t even think of touching it, you will be prosecuted for violating national security,'” he told us. * * * “I am confident that there is conversation inside the Government as to ‘How do we deal with Sibel?'” contends Ellsberg. “The first line of defense is to ensure that she doesn’t get into the media. I think any outlet that thought of using her materials would go to to the government and they would be told ‘don’t touch this . . . .‘”

Of course, if the stick approach doesn’t work, the government can always just pay off reporters to spread disinformation. Indeed, an expert on propaganda testified under oath during trial that the CIA employs THOUSANDS of reporters and OWNS its own media organizations (the expert has an impressive background).

And famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein says the CIA has already bought and paid for many successful journalists. See also this New York Times piece, this essay by the Independent, this speech by one of the premier writers on journalism, and this and this roundup.

Indeed, in the final analysis, the main reason today that the media giants will not cover the real stories or question the government’s actions or policies in any meaningful way is that we live in a country that is not all that free (see point number 6). Mussolini said that fascism is the blending of the government and corporate interests, and the American government and mainstream media have in fact been blended together to an unprecedented degree.

See this book and the following 5-part interview for further information on 9/11 and the media: (Part 1 • Part 2 • Part 3 • Part 4 • Part 5

But what happens on the sun doesn’t stay on the sun.

As I pointed out last year:

It is known that intense solar activity can destroy ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere, thus affecting climactic temperatures. See this, this, this, this and this. Indeed, the effects of solar energy on ozone may be one of the main ways in which the sun influences Earth’s climate. The sun itself also affects the Earth more than previously understood. For example, according to the European Space Agency:

Scientists … have proven that sounds generated deep inside the Sun cause the Earth to shake and vibrate in sympathy. They have found that Earth’s magnetic field, atmosphere and terrestrial systems, all take part in this cosmic sing-along.





And NASA has just discovered that “space weather” causes “spacequakes” on Earth:



Researchers using NASA’s fleet of five THEMIS spacecraft have discovered a form of space weather that packs the punch of an earthquake and plays a key role in sparking bright Northern Lights. They call it “the spacequake.” A spacequake is a temblor in Earth’s magnetic field. It is felt most strongly in Earth orbit, but is not exclusive to space. The effects can reach all the way down to the surface of Earth itself. “Magnetic reverberations have been detected at ground stations all around the globe, much like seismic detectors measure a large earthquake,” says THEMIS principal investigator Vassilis Angelopoulos of UCLA. It’s an apt analogy because “the total energy in a spacequake can rival that of a magnitude 5 or 6 earthquake,” according to Evgeny Panov of the Space Research Institute in Austria. *** “Now we know,” says THEMIS project scientist David Sibeck of the Goddard Space Flight Center. “Plasma jets trigger spacequakes.” According to THEMIS, the jets crash into the geomagnetic field some 30,000 km above Earth’s equator. The impact sets off a rebounding process, in which the incoming plasma actually bounces up and down on the reverberating magnetic field. Researchers call it “repetitive flow rebuffing.” It’s akin to a tennis ball bouncing up and down on a carpeted floor. The first bounce is a big one, followed by bounces of decreasing amplitude as energy is dissipated in the carpet. *** “When plasma jets hit the inner magnetosphere, vortices with opposite sense of rotation appear and reappear on either side of the plasma jet,” explains Rumi Nakamura of the Space Research Institute in Austria, a co-author of the study. “We believe the vortices can generate substantial electrical currents in the near-Earth environment.” Acting together, vortices and spacequakes could have a noticeable effect on Earth. The tails of vortices may funnel particles into Earth’s atmosphere, sparking auroras and making waves of ionization that disturb radio communications and GPS. By tugging on surface magnetic fields, spacequakes generate currents in the very ground we walk on. Ground current surges can have profound consequences, in extreme cases bringing down power grids over a wide area.

What does this mean?

Some allege that spacequakes cause actual, physical earthquakes on Earth. I have no idea whether or not that is true.

The above-quoted NASA article concludes with a poem which implies such a connection:



Vortices swirl

plasma a’twirl

Richter predicts

a magnitude six

However, the poem may use artistic license rather than scientific rigor.

Activist Post

The Wall Street Journal has confirmed what many suspected, that the West’s so-called “evidence” of the latest alleged “chemical attacks” in Syria, pinned on the Syrian government are fabrications spun up from the West’s own dubious intelligence agencies.

The Wall Street Journal reveals that the US is citing claims from Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency fed to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), a repeat of the fabrications that led up to the Iraq War, the Libyan War, and have been used now for 3 years to justify continued support of extremists operating within and along Syria’s borders.

Wall Street Journal’s article, “U.S., Allies Prepare to Act as Syria Intelligence Mounts,” states:

One crucial piece of the emerging case came from Israeli spy services, which provided the Central Intelligence Agency with intelligence from inside an elite special Syrian unit that oversees Mr. Assad’s chemical weapons, Arab diplomats said. The intelligence, which the CIA was able to verify, showed that certain types of chemical weapons were moved in advance to the same Damascus suburbs where the attack allegedly took place a week ago, Arab diplomats said.

Both Mossad and the CIA are clearly compromised in terms of objectivity and legitimacy. Neither exists nor is expected to provide impartial evidence, but rather to facilitate by all means necessary the self-serving agendas, interests, and objectives of their respective governments.

That both Israel and the United States, as far back as 2007 have openly conspired together to overthrow the government of Syria through a carefully engineered sectarian bloodbath, discredits entirely their respective intelligence agencies. This is precisely why an impartial, objective third-party investigation has been called for by the international community and agreed upon by the Syrian government – a third-party investigation the US has now urged to be canceled ahead of its planned military strikes.

The Wall Street Journal reports:

In an email on Sunday, White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice told U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power and other top officials that the U.N. mission was pointless because the chemical weapons evidence already was conclusive, officials said. The U.S. privately urged the U.N. to pull the inspectors out, setting the stage for President Barack Obama to possibly move forward with a military response, officials said.

The US then, not Syria, is attempting a coverup, with fabrications in place from discredited, compromised intelligence sources and the threat of impending military strikes that would endanger the UN inspection team’s safety should they fail to end their investigation and withdraw.

The Wall Street Journal also reiterated that the US is planning to fully sidestep the UN Security Council and proceed with its partners unilaterally:

…if the U.S. chose to strike, it would do so with allies and without the U.N., in order to sidestep an expected Russian veto.

The US proceeds now with absolute disregard for international law, all but declaring it has no intention of providing credible evidence of its accusations against the Syrian government. It is a rush to war with all the hallmarks of dangerous desperation as the West’s proxy forces collapse before the Syrian military. Western military leaders must consider the strategic tenants and historical examples regarding the dangers and folly of haste and imprudence in war – especially war fought to protect special interests and political agendas rather than to defend territory.

The populations of the West must likewise consider what benefits they have garnered from the last decade of military conquest their leaders have indulged in. Crumbling economies gutted to feed the preservation of special interests and the growing domestic security apparatuses to keep these interests safe from both domestic and foreign dissent are problems that will only grow more acute.

Outside of the West, in Moscow, Beijing, and Tehran, leaders must consider a future where Western special interests can invade with impunity, without public support, or even the tenuous semblance of justification being necessary.

As a story in the Christian Science Monitor shows, the Gulf oil spill is much worse than we’ve been told: It’s now likely that the actual amount of the oil spill dwarfs the Coast Guard’s figure of 5,000 barrels, or 210,000 gallons, a day. Independent scientists estimate that the renegade wellhead at the bottom of the Gulf could be spewing up to 25,000 barrels a day. If chokeholds on the riser pipe break down further, up to 50,000 barrels a day could be released, according to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration memo obtained by the Mobile, Ala., Press-Register. As estimates of the spill increase, questions about the government’s honesty in assessing the spill are emerging. *** “The following is not public,” reads National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Emergency Response document dated April 28, according to the Press-Register [see this]. “Two additional release points were found today. If the riser pipe deteriorates further, the flow could become unchecked resulting in a release volume an order of magnitude higher than previously thought.”

An order of magnitude is a factor of 10. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that John Amos, an oil industry consultant, said that NOAA revised its original estimate of 1,000 barrels after he published calculations based on satellite data that showed a larger flow.

The 5,000 barrels a day is the “extremely low end” of estimates, Mr. Amos told the Journal. CNN quotes the lead government official responding to the spill – the commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Thad Allen – as stating: If we lost a total well head, it could be 100,000 barrels or more a day.

Indeed, an environmental document filed by BP estimates the maximum as 162,000 barrels a day:

In an exploration plan and environmental impact analysis filed with the federal government in February 2009, BP said it had the capability to handle a “worst-case scenario” at the Deepwater Horizon site, which the document described as a leak of 162,000 barrels per day from an uncontrolled blowout — 6.8 million gallons each day.

Now, I am warning that the amount of oil still in the reservoir might be much bigger than BP is admitting.

Specifically, BP claims that there are 50 million barrels worth of oil in the reservoir underneath the leaking spill site.

But the Guardian noted Friday:

But the 50m figure cited by Hayward took some industry insiders by surprise. There have been reports the reservoir held up to 500m barrels – the figure quoted by Hayward’s questioner, Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas. “I would assume that 500m barrels would be a more likely estimate,” said Tadeusz Patzek, the chairman of the department of petroleum and geosystems engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. “I don’t think you would be going after a 50mbarrel reservoir so quickly. This is just simply not enough oil to go after.”

Indeed, Wolf Blitzer said:

One — one expert said to me — and I don’t know if this is overblown or not — that they’re still really concerned about the structural base of this whole operation, if the rocks get moved, this thing could really explode and they’re sitting, what, on — on a billion potential barrels of oil at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.

Bloomberg notes:

The ruptured well may hold as much as 1 billion barrels, the Times reported, citing Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis in Massachusetts.

Oil industry expert Matthew Simmons also puts the number above one billion barrels (see this Bloomberg interview, for example, where he says that – unless stopped – 120,000 barrels a day will leak for 25-30 years; that adds up to 1,095,000,000 to 1,314,000,000 barrels).



And Rob Kall claims that a source inside BP tells him:

Size of reservoir – estimated by BP and its partner, Andarko to be between 2.5B and 10B bbl. (that’s 100,000,000,000 gallons and 400,000,000,000 gallons).

Yes – all of those numbers are BILLIONS.

Given that BP’s nearby Tiber and Kaskida wells each contain at least 3 billion barrels of oil (see this, this, this and this), estimates of more than a billion barrels for the leaking Macondo reservoir are not unreasonable.

Why the Size of the Reservoir Matters

The size of the reservoir is important for several reasons. Specifically, the more oil in the Macondo reservoir, the longer the oil leak will flow if the efforts to cap it fail.

Moreover, higher volumes of oil and gas might change the pressure of materials gushing out of the leaking well. As CBS notes:

The oil emanating from the seafloor contains about 40 percent methane, compared with about 5 percent found in typical oil deposits, said John Kessler, a Texas A&M University oceanographer who is studying the impact of methane from the spill.

I will leave it to the scientists to calculate what a larger volume of oil (with 40% methane) would mean for pressure. Higher pressure may make it harder to cap the leak, and may wear out the casing quicker by speeding up the rate at which sand and other small particles in the oil abrade the metal. Lower pressure would ease both problems.

Finally, the more oil and gas in the reservoir, the higher a priority the government may consider it to produce the well at all costs.

(May 20, 2011). ECB Working Paper No. 1346. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1847503

The paper studies ""the importance of financial activity in determining the spot price of oil relative to the role of oil market fundamentals"", using a sign-restricted structural VAR model. The model allows the study authors to separate financial activities into two types: stabilizing and destabilizing. This is achieved by postulating a model that links ""the oil spot market to the futures market through a no-arbitrage condition"", so that:

Destabilizing financial shock is identified as one that creates ""a deviation from the no-arbitrage condition, thereby ...driving oil futures prices away from the levels justified by oil market fundamentals.

is identified as one that creates ""a deviation from the no-arbitrage condition, thereby ...driving oil futures prices away from the levels justified by oil market fundamentals. Stabilizing financial activity is defined as ""driven by changes in oil supply and demand-side fundamentals"".

an oil supply shock

an oil demand shock driven by economic activity

an oil-specific demand shock which captures changes in oil demand other than those caused by economic activity, and

a destabilizing financial shock (such as a spike in speculative activity).

The results suggest that

Financial activity in the futures market can significantly affect oil prices in the spot market, although only in the short run.

The destabilizing financial shock (speculation) only explains about 10 percent of the total variability in oil prices.

Shocks to fundamentals ""are clearly more important over our sample. Indeed, looking at specific points in time, the gradual run-up in oil prices between 2002 and the summer of 2008 was mainly driven by a series of stronger-than-expected oil demand shocks on the back of booming economic activity, in combination with an increasingly tight oil supply from mid 2004 on. Strong demand-side growth together with stagnating supply were also the main driving factors behind the surge in oil prices in 2007-mid 2008, and the drop in oil prices in the second half of 2008 can be mainly explained by a substantial fallback in economic activity following the financial crisis and the associated decline in global oil demand. Since the beginning of 2009, rising oil demand on the back of a recovering global economy also drove most of the recovery in oil prices.""

However, the study did find that financial investors ""did cause oil prices to significantly diverge from the level justified by oil supply and demand at specific points in time. In general, inefficient financial activity in the futures market pushed oil prices about 15 percent above the level justified by (current and expected) oil fundamentals over the period 2000-mid 2008, when the volume of crude oil derivatives traded on NYMEX quintupled. Particularly in 2007-2008, destabilizing financial shocks aggravated the volatility present in the oil market and caused oil prices to respectively over- and undershoot their fundamental values by significant amounts, although oil fundamentals clearly remain more important.""





So some speculation is harmful to fundamentals-determined pricing, although the study does not consider the potential benefits from speculation-induced greater liquidity in the markets (which was not the core objective of the study to begin with), but largely, 5-fold increase in speculative activity accounts for just 10 percent of prices variability.

That ""Gotcha..."" moment, you know... speaking last night at a round table discussion on the future of Europe, I was confronted with a question from the audience and a fellow panelist remarks in the same vein that, roughly speaking, attributed the entire current crisis in Europe to the derivatives markets and speculative investment. More than that, the same were blamed for everything from the environmental disasters to increases in commodity prices. Some parts of the Left just love the idea of finding a ""capitalist"" (even arch-capitalist - aka speculative) root to every problem - the ""Gotcha..."" thingy of pseudo intellectualist disdain for facts as much as for 'speculators' and 'markets'.This of course does not mean that financial instrumentation, speculation or other forces of the financial markets did not contribute to the crisis, but it is a distinct claim from the one made by those proposing that they caused the crisis single-handedly.By sheer accident, looking through some old research papers, I came across this study from the ECB:The study looks into the large oil price fluctuations that were observed in the recent years. In particular, the study considers the role of financial activities in the determination of oil prices.Per study (emphasis is mine):""The oil futures market has indeed become increasingly liquid, and the activity of agents that do not deal with physical oil, the so-called non-commercials, has greatly increased.

The Press-Register reports today:

Scientific analysis has confirmed that oil bubbling up above BP’s sealed Deepwater Horizon well in recent days is a chemical match for the hundreds of millions of gallons of oil that spewed into the Gulf last summer. The Press-Register collected samples of the oil about a mile from the well site on Tuesday and provided them to Ed Overton and Scott Miles, chemists with Louisiana State University. The pair did much of the chemical work used by federal officials to fingerprint the BP oil, known as MC252. “After examining the data, I think it’s a dead ringer for the MC252 oil, as good a match as I’ve seen,” Overton wrote in an email to the newspaper. “My guess is that it is probably coming from the broken riser pipe or sunken platform. … However, it should be confirmed, just to make sure there is no leak from the plugged well.”

MC252 is short for Macondo block 252, which is the official designation for the location of last year’s BP Gulf oil spill.

Overton is a LSU professor and oil spill expert, who has been a lead NOAA consultant for decades, and who analyzing Macondo oil samples last year for the federal government.

The Leak Is Associated With BP’s Well





The Press-Register reported yesterday:

Oil is once again fouling the Gulf of Mexico around the Deepwater Horizon well, which was capped a little over a year ago. [Deepwater Horizon is the name of the oil drilling rig drilling at BP’s Macondo well, the one which exploded and sank last year.] Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of small, circular patches of oily sheen dotted the surface within a mile of the wellhead. With just a bare sheen present over about a quarter-mile, the scene was a far cry from the massive slick that covered the Gulf last summer.

***

Floating in a boat near the well site, Press-Register reporters watched blobs of oil rise to the surface and bloom into iridescent yellow patches. Those patches quickly expanded into rainbow sheens 4 to 5 feet across. Each expanding bloom released a pronounced and pungent petroleum smell. ***

“I think the primary source with high probability is associated with the Macondo well,” said Robert Bea, an internationally prominent petroleum engineer and professor emeritus at the Berkeley campus of the University of California. Bea responded to Press-Register questions via email after examining photographs taken by the newspaper. “Perhaps connections that developed between the well annulus (outside the casing), the reservoir sands about 17,000 feet below the seafloor, and the natural seep fault features” could provide a pathway for oil to move from deep underground to the seafloor, Bea said. “Looks suspicious. The point of surfacing about 1 mile from the well is about the point that the oil should show up, given the seafloor at 5,000 feet … natural circulation currents would cause the drift,” Bea said.



We May Never Be Able To Fully Stop the BP Leak

Washington’s Blog interviewed Dr. Bea a year ago, and the oil expert noted that we may never be able to fully stop BP’s oil leak:



Few people in the world know more about oil drilling disasters than Dr. Robert Bea.

Bea teaches engineering at the University of California Berkeley, and has 55 years of experience in engineering and management of design, construction, maintenance, operation, and decommissioning of engineered systems including offshore platforms, pipelines and floating facilities. Bea has worked for many years in governmental and quasi-governmental roles, and has been a high-level governmental adviser concerning disasters. He worked for 16 years as a top mechanical engineer and manager for Shell Oil, and has worked with Bechtel and the Army Corps of Engineers. One of the world’s top experts in offshore drilling problems, Bea is a member of the Deepwater Horizon Study Group, and has been interviewed by news media around the world concerning the BP oil disaster. ***

WB: Is it possible that this fractured, subsea salt geology will make it difficult to permanently kill the oil leak using relief wells? Bea: Yes, it could. The Santa Barbara channel seeps are still leaking, decades after the oil well was supposedly capped. This well could keep leaking for years. Scripps mapped out seafloor seeps in the area of the well prior to the blowout. Some of the natural seeps penetrate 10,000 to 15,000 feet beneath the seafloor. The oil will follow lines of weakness in the geology. The leak can travel several horizontal miles from the location of the leak.

[In other words, the geology beneath the seafloor is so fractured, with soft and unstable salt formations, that we may never be able to fully kill the well even with relief wells. Instead, the loss of containment of the oil reservoir caused by the drilling accident could cause oil to leak out through seeps for years to come. See this and this for further background]. *** WB: I have heard that BP is underestimating the size of the oil reservoir (and see this). Is it possible that the reservoir is bigger than BP is estimating, and so – if not completely killed – the leak could therefore go on for longer than most assume?

Bea: That’s plausible.

WB: The chief electronics technician on the Deepwater Horizon said that the Macondo well was originally drilled in another location, but that “going faster caused the bottom of the well to split open, swallowing tools”, and that BP abandoned that well. You’ve spoken to that technician and looked into the incident, and concluded that “they damn near blew up the rig.” [See this and this]. Do you know where that abandoned well location is, and do you know if that well is still leaking?

Bea: The abandoned well is very close to the current well location. BP had to file reports showing the location of the abandoned well and the new well [with the Minerals Management Service], so the location of the abandoned well is known.

We don’t know if the abandoned well is leaking. WB: Matthew Simmons talked about a second leaking well. There are rumors on the Internet that the original well is still leaking. Do you have any information that can either disprove or confirm that allegation?

Bea: There are two uncorroborated reports. One is that there is a leak 400 feet West of the present well’s surface location. There is another report that there is a leak several miles to the West. [Bea does not know whether either report is true at this time, because BP is not sharing information with the government, let alone the public.]

Indeed, in June of 2010, BP officials admitted to damage beneath the seafloor, and numerous scientists have speculated that the blowout and subsequent clumsy attempts by BP to plug the well could have created new seeps, and made pre-existing natural seeps bigger.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"BP’s Gulf Oil Well Is Leaking Again: “It’s A Dead Ringer For The [BP] Oil, As Good A Match As I’ve Seen” … “I Think The Primary Source With High Probability Is Associated With [Last Year’s Damaged BP]","Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد",,[''],,,,

I’m copying below my article on this issue from last month. As journalist Harvey Wasserman noted on a radio program today, it is “criminal” that the government is not testing fish. The bottom line – as nuclear expert Arnie Gundersen notes – is that we must demand that our elected representatives require testing.

The FDA says it won’t monitor radiation in fish on the West Coast of the U.S. As the Anchorage Daily News notes:

North Pacific fish are so unlikely to be contaminated by radioactive material from the crippled nuclear plant in Japan that there’s no reason to test them, state and federal officials said this week. *** DeLancey, the FDA spokeswoman, said “We have not been doing any testing. We’ve been working with NOAA to keep an eye on U.S. waters, to see if there is any cause for alarm, and we do have the capability to begin testing if that does occur.” Asked to explain what kind of monitoring was taking place in the ocean, DeLancey said, “You would have to talk directly to NOAA … I don’t really want to speak for another agency.” But NOAA fisheries spokeswoman Kate Naughton declined to answer questions and referred a reporter back to DeLancey and the EPA. DeLancey said that so far, there’s no reason for concern about Fukushima. The radioactive materials in the water near Fukushima quickly become diluted in the massive volume of the Pacific, she said. Additionally, radioactive fallout that lands on the surface tends to stay there, giving the most unstable ones isotopes like iodine time to decay before reaching fish, she said.

Of course, radioactive isotopes like cesium 137 are very long-lived, and so won’t necessarily decay before they reach fish.

And – in typical Orwellian agency-speak – the FDA is trying to reassure people that eating contaminated fish poses no health risk. As the Wall Street Journal notes:

U.S. public-health officials sought Tuesday to reassure consumers about the safety of food in the U.S., including seafood, amid news that fish contaminated with unusually high levels of radioactive materials had been caught in waters 50 miles from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan. No contaminated fish have turned up in the U.S., or in U.S. waters, according to experts from the Food and Drug Administration [which isn’t testing], Environmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They expressed confidence that even a single fish sufficiently contaminated to pose a risk to human health would be detected by the U.S. monitoring system. [But would the government announce such detection?] They also dismissed concerns that eating fish contaminated at the levels seen so far in Japan would pose such a risk. [Alexander Higgins points out that Japanese fish exceed federal radiation limits by 2400%] Thomas Frieden, head of the CDC in Atlanta, said he expected continued detection of low levels of radioactive elements in the water, air and food in the U.S. in coming days, but that readings at those levels “do not indicate any level of public health concern.”

Is this yet another example of the government responding to the nuclear accident by trying to raise acceptable radiation levels and pretending that radiation is good for us?

Indeed, the ocean currents head from Japan to the West Coast of the U.S.

As AP notes:

The floating debris will likely be carried by currents off of Japan toward Washington, Oregon and California before turning toward Hawaii and back again toward Asia, circulating in what is known as the North Pacific gyre, said Curt Ebbesmeyer, a Seattle oceanographer who has spent decades tracking flotsam. ***

“All this debris will find a way to reach the West coast or stop in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” a swirling mass of concentrated marine litter in the Pacific Ocean, said Luca Centurioni, a researcher at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego.

Here is what the North Pacific Gyre looks like:

NPR reports:

CNN said that “the Hawaiian islands may get a new and unwelcome addition in coming months — a giant new island of debris floating in from Japan.” It relied in part on work done by the University of Hawaii’s International Pacific Research Center, which predicts that: “In three years, the [debris] plume will reach the U.S. West Coast, dumping debris on Californian beaches and the beaches of British Columbia, Alaska, and Baja California. The debris will then drift into the famous North Pacific Garbage Patch, where it will wander around and break into smaller and smaller pieces. In five years, Hawaii shores can expect to see another barrage of debris that is stronger and longer lastingthan the first one. Much of the debris leaving the North Pacific Garbage Patch ends up on Hawaii’s reefs and beaches.” The research center has an animated graphic showing the debris field’s likely route posted online here. And it has images of how the debris field will circulate, from this month (in upper left corner) to March 2016 (lower right). Enlarge University of Hawaii’s International Pacific Research Center The projected path of the debris field, from March of this year (in upper left), through March 2016 (lower right). That’s the Pacific Ocean, with Japan to the left and the west coast of the U.S. to the right. Hawaii is the small chain of islands in the center. University of Hawaii’s International Pacific Research Center

Indeed, CNN notes:

The debris mass, which appears as an island from the air, contains cars, trucks, tractors, boats and entire houses floating in the current heading toward the U.S. and Canada, according to ABC News.

The bulk of the debris will likely not be radioactive, as it was presumably washed out to sea during the initial tsunami – before much radioactivity had leaked. But this shows the power of the currents from Japan to the West Coast.

Of course, fish don’t necessarily stay still, either. For example, the Telegraph notes that scientists tagged a bluefin tuna and found that it crossed between Japan and the West Coast three times in 600 days:

That might be extreme, but the point is that fish exposed to radiation somewhere out in the ocean might end up in U.S. waters.

Nuclear engineer Arnie Gundersen doesn’t think there will be a risk within the next year. But as the plume spreads across the Pacific, and as small fish get eaten by bigger fish (i.e. bioaccumulation), it would be prudent to measure radiation in fish caught off the West Coast of the U.S. (and Hawaii), and Gundersen suggests we contact our representatives and demand measurement:

7968,3275556,lewrockwell.com,bias,https://www.lewrockwell.com/2006/08/john-v-denson/the-hiroshima-myth/,"Every year during the first two weeks of August the mass news media and many politicians at the national level trot out the ""patriotic"" political myth that the dropping of the two atomic bombs on Japan in August of 1945 caused them to surrender, and thereby saved the lives of anywhere from five hundred thousand to one million American soldiers, who did not have to invade the islands. Opinion polls over the last fifty years show that American citizens overwhelmingly (between 80 and 90%) believe this false history which, of course, makes them feel better about killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians (mostly women and children) and saving American lives to accomplish the ending of the war.

The best book, in my opinion, to explode this myth is The Decision to Use the Bomb by Gar Alperovitz, because it not only explains the real reasons the bombs were dropped, but also gives a detailed history of how and why the myth was created that this slaughter of innocent civilians was justified, and therefore morally acceptable. The essential problem starts with President Franklin Roosevelt's policy of unconditional surrender, which was reluctantly adopted by Churchill and Stalin, and which President Truman decided to adopt when he succeeded Roosevelt in April of 1945. Hanson Baldwin was the principal writer for The New York Times who covered World War II and he wrote an important book immediately after the war entitled Great Mistakes of the War. Baldwin concludes that the unconditional surrender policy "". . . was perhaps the biggest political mistake of the war . . . . Unconditional surrender was an open invitation to unconditional resistance; it discouraged opposition to Hitler, probably lengthened the war, costs us lives, and helped to lead to the present aborted peace.""

The stark fact is that the Japanese leaders, both military and civilian, including the Emperor, were willing to surrender in May of 1945 if the Emperor could remain in place and not be subjected to a war crimes trial after the war. This fact became known to President Truman as early as May of 1945. The Japanese monarchy was one of the oldest in all of history dating back to 660 B.C. The Japanese religion added the belief that all the Emperors were the direct descendants of the sun goddess, Amaterasu. The reigning Emperor Hirohito was the 124th in the direct line of descent. After the bombs were dropped on August 6 and 9 of 1945, and their surrender soon thereafter, the Japanese were allowed to keep their Emperor on the throne and he was not subjected to any war crimes trial. The Emperor, Hirohito, came on the throne in 1926 and continued in his position until his death in 1989. Since President Truman, in effect, accepted the conditional surrender offered by the Japanese as early as May of 1945, the question is posed, ""Why then were the bombs dropped?""

The author Alperovitz gives us the answer in great detail which can only be summarized here, but he states, ""We have noted a series of Japanese peace feelers in Switzerland which OSS Chief William Donovan reported to Truman in May and June [1945]. These suggested, even at this point, that the U.S. demand for unconditional surrender might well be the only serious obstacle to peace. At the center of the explorations, as we also saw, was Allen Dulles, chief of OSS operations in Switzerland (and subsequently Director of the CIA). In his 1966 book The Secret Surrender, Dulles recalled that u2018On July 20, 1945, under instructions from Washington, I went to the Potsdam Conference and reported there to Secretary [of War] Stimson on what I had learned from Tokyo — they desired to surrender if they could retain the Emperor and their constitution as a basis for maintaining discipline and order in Japan after the devastating news of surrender became known to the Japanese people.'"" It is documented by Alperovitz that Stimson reported this directly to Truman. Alperovitz further points out in detail the documentary proof that every top presidential civilian and military advisor, with the exception of James Byrnes, along with Prime Minister Churchill and his top British military leadership, urged Truman to revise the unconditional surrender policy so as to allow the Japanese to surrender and keep their Emperor. All this advice was given to Truman prior to the Potsdam Proclamation which occurred on July 26, 1945. This proclamation made a final demand upon Japan to surrender unconditionally or suffer drastic consequences.

Another startling fact about the military connection to the dropping of the bomb is the lack of knowledge on the part of General MacArthur about the existence of the bomb and whether it was to be dropped. Alperovitz states ""MacArthur knew nothing about advance planning for the atomic bomb's use until almost the last minute. Nor was he personally in the chain of command in this connection; the order came straight from Washington. Indeed, the War Department waited until five days before the bombing of Hiroshima even to notify MacArthur — the commanding general of the U.S. Army Forces in the Pacific — of the existence of the atomic bomb.""

Alperovitz makes it very clear that the main person Truman was listening to while he ignored all of this civilian and military advice, was James Byrnes, the man who virtually controlled Truman at the beginning of his administration. Byrnes was one of the most experienced political figures in Washington, having served for over thirty years in both the House and the Senate. He had also served as a United States Supreme Court Justice, and at the request of President Roosevelt, he resigned that position and accepted the role in the Roosevelt administration of managing the domestic economy. Byrnes went to the Yalta Conference with Roosevelt and then was given the responsibility to get Congress and the American people to accept the agreements made at Yalta.

When Truman became a senator in 1935, Byrnes immediately became his friend and mentor and remained close to Truman until Truman became president. Truman never forgot this and immediately called on Byrnes to be his number-two man in the new administration. Byrnes had expected to be named the vice presidential candidate to replace Wallace and had been disappointed when Truman had been named, yet he and Truman remained very close. Byrnes had also been very close to Roosevelt, while Truman was kept in the dark by Roosevelt most of the time he served as vice president. Truman asked Byrnes immediately, in April, to become his Secretary of State but they delayed the official appointment until July 3, 1945, so as not to offend the incumbent. Byrnes had also accepted a position on the interim committee which had control over the policy regarding the atom bomb, and therefore, in April, 1945 became Truman's main foreign policy advisor, and especially the advisor on the use of the atomic bomb. It was Byrnes who encouraged Truman to postpone the Potsdam Conference and his meeting with Stalin until they could know, at the conference, if the atomic bomb was successfully tested. While at the Potsdam Conference the experiments proved successful and Truman advised Stalin that a new massively destructive weapon was now available to America, which Byrnes hoped would make Stalin back off from any excessive demands or activity in the post-war period.

Truman secretly gave the orders on July 25, 1945 that the bombs would be dropped in August while he was to be in route back to America. On July 26, he issued the Potsdam Proclamation, or ultimatum, to Japan to surrender, leaving in place the unconditional surrender policy, thereby causing both Truman and Byrnes to believe that the terms would not be accepted by Japan.

The conclusion drawn unmistakably from the evidence presented, is that Byrnes is the man who convinced Truman to keep the unconditional surrender policy and not accept Japan's surrender so that the bombs could actually be dropped thereby demonstrating to the Russians that America had a new forceful leader in place, a ""new sheriff in Dodge"" who, unlike Roosevelt, was going to be tough with the Russians on foreign policy and that the Russians needed to ""back off"" during what would become known as the ""Cold War."" A secondary reason was that Congress would now be told about why they had made the secret appropriation to a Manhattan Project and the huge expenditure would be justified by showing that not only did the bombs work but that they would bring the war to an end, make the Russians back off and enable America to become the most powerful military force in the world.

If the surrender by the Japanese had been accepted between May and the end of July of 1945 and the Emperor had been left in place, as in fact he was after the bombing, this would have kept Russia out of the war. Russia agreed at Yalta to come into the Japanese war three months after Germany surrendered. In fact, Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945 and Russia announced on August 8, (exactly three months thereafter) that it was abandoning its neutrality policy with Japan and entering the war. Russia's entry into the war for six days allowed them to gain tremendous power and influence in China, Korea, and other key areas of Asia. The Japanese were deathly afraid of Communism and if the Potsdam Proclamation had indicated that America would accept the conditional surrender allowing the Emperor to remain in place and informed the Japanese that Russia would enter the war if they did not surrender, then this would surely have assured a quick Japanese surrender.

The second question that Alperovitz answers in the last half of the book is how and why the Hiroshima myth was created. The story of the myth begins with the person of James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University, who was a prominent scientist, having initially made his mark as a chemist working on poison gas during World War I. During World War II, he was chairman of the National Defense Research Committee from the summer of 1941 until the end of the war and he was one of the central figures overseeing the Manhattan Project. Conant became concerned about his future academic career, as well as his positions in private industry, because various people began to speak out concerning why the bombs were dropped. On September 9, 1945, Admiral William F. Halsey, commander of the Third Fleet, was publically quoted extensively as stating that the atomic bomb was used because the scientists had a ""toy and they wanted to try it out . . . ."" He further stated, ""The first atomic bomb was an unnecessary experiment . . . . It was a mistake to ever drop it."" Albert Einstein, one of the world's foremost scientists, who was also an important person connected with the development of the atomic bomb, responded and his words were headlined in The New York Times ""Einstein Deplores Use of Atom Bomb."" The story reported that Einstein stated that ""A great majority of scientists were opposed to the sudden employment of the atom bomb."" In Einstein's judgment, the dropping of the bomb was a political — diplomatic decision rather than a military or scientific decision.

Probably the person closest to Truman, from the military standpoint, was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Leahy, and there was much talk that he also deplored the use of the bomb and had strongly advised Truman not to use it, but advised rather to revise the unconditional surrender policy so that the Japanese could surrender and keep the Emperor. Leahy's views were later reported by Hanson Baldwin in an interview that Leahy ""thought the business of recognizing the continuation of the Emperor was a detail which should have been solved easily."" Leahy's secretary, Dorothy Ringquist, reported that Leahy told her on the day the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, ""Dorothy, we will regret this day. The United States will suffer, for war is not to be waged on women and children."" Another important naval voice, the commander in chief of the U.S. Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations, Ernest J. King, stated that the naval blockade and prior bombing of Japan in March of 1945, had rendered the Japanese helpless and that the use of the atomic bomb was both unnecessary and immoral. Also, the opinion of Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz was reported to have said in a press conference on September 22, 1945, that ""The Admiral took the opportunity of adding his voice to those insisting that Japan had been defeated before the atomic bombing and Russia's entry into the war."" In a subsequent speech at the Washington Monument on October 5, 1945, Admiral Nimitz stated ""The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace before the atomic age was announced to the world with the destruction of Hiroshima and before the Russian entry into the war."" It was learned also that on or about July 20, 1945, General Eisenhower had urged Truman, in a personal visit, not to use the atomic bomb. Eisenhower's assessment was ""It wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing . . . to use the atomic bomb, to kill and terrorize civilians, without even attempting [negotiations], was a double crime."" Eisenhower also stated that it wasn't necessary for Truman to ""succumb"" to Byrnes.

James Conant came to the conclusion that some important person in the administration must go public to show that the dropping of the bombs was a military necessity, thereby saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers, so he approached Harvey Bundy and his son, McGeorge Bundy. It was agreed by them that the most important person to create this myth was Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. It was decided that Stimson would write a long article to be widely circulated in a prominent national magazine. This article was revised repeatedly by McGeorge Bundy and Conant before it was published in Harper's magazine in February of 1947. The long article became the subject of a front-page article and editorial in The New York Times and in the editorial it was stated ""There can be no doubt that the president and Mr. Stimson are right when they mention that the bomb caused the Japanese to surrender."" Later, in 1959, President Truman specifically endorsed this conclusion, including the idea that it saved the lives of a million American soldiers. This myth has been renewed annually by the news media and various political leaders ever since.

It is very pertinent that, in the memoirs of Henry Stimson entitled On Active Service in Peace and War, he states, ""Unfortunately, I have lived long enough to know that history is often not what actually happened but what is recorded as such.""

To bring this matter more into focus from the human tragedy standpoint, I recommend the reading of a book entitled Hiroshima Diary: The Journal of a Japanese Physician, August 6, September 30, 1945, by Michiko Hachiya. He was a survivor of Hiroshima and kept a daily diary about the women, children and old men that he treated on a daily basis in the hospital. The doctor was badly injured himself but recovered enough to help others and his account of the personal tragedies of innocent civilians who were either badly burned or died as a result of the bombing puts the moral issue into a clear perspective for all of us to consider.

Now that we live in the nuclear age and there are enough nuclear weapons spread around the world to destroy civilization, we need to face the fact that America is the only country to have used this awful weapon and that it was unnecessary to have done so. If Americans would come to recognize the truth, rather than the myth, it might cause such a moral revolt that we would take the lead throughout the world in realizing that wars in the future may well become nuclear, and therefore all wars must be avoided at almost any cost. Hopefully, our knowledge of science has not outrun our ability to exercise prudent and humane moral and political judgment to the extent that we are destined for extermination.

Bea teaches engineering at the University of California Berkeley, and has 55 years of experience in engineering and management of design, construction, maintenance, operation, and decommissioning of engineered systems including offshore platforms, pipelines and floating facilities. Bea has worked for many years in governmental and quasi-governmental roles, and has been a high-level governmental adviser concerning disasters. He worked for 16 years as a top mechanical engineer and manager for Shell Oil, and has worked with Bechtel and the Army Corps of Engineers. One of the world’s top experts in offshore drilling problems, Bea is a member of the Deepwater Horizon Study Group, and has been interviewed by news media around the world concerning the BP oil disaster.

Washington’s Blog spoke with Dr. Bea yesterday.

WB: Is BP sharing information with the government?

Bea: No. BP is using a “cloak of silence”. BP is not voluntarily sharing information or documents with the government.

In May, for example, Senator Boxer subpoenaed information from BP regarding footage of the seafloor taken before the blowout by BP’s remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). We still have not received a response 12 weeks later.

[Bea subsequently clarified that he’s not sure whether BP has failed to release the information, or Senator Boxer’s committee has sat on the information. My bet is on BP. Indeed, BP has refused to answer some very basic written questions from Congressman Markey, chair of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. See this and this. Indeed, it is unclear whether BP is sharing vital details even with Thad Allen, Secretary of energy Chu, or the Unified Command].

WB: Might there be problems with the relief wells? I know that it took a couple of relief wells to finally stop the Ixtoc leak, and it has taken as many as 5 relief wells to stop some blowouts.

Bea: Yes, it could take repeated attempts.

WB: Are there any conditions at BP’s well which might make killing the leak with relief wells more difficult than with the average deepwater oil spill?

Bea: That’s an interesting question. You have to ask why did this location blow out when nearby wells drilled in even deeper water didn’t blow out.

You have to look at the geology of the Macondo well. It is in a subsalt location, in a Sigsbee salt formation. [For background, see this and this]

The geology is fractured.

Usually, the deeper you drill, the more pressure it takes to fracture rock. This is called the “fracture gradient“.

But when BP was drilling this well, the fracture gradient reversed. Indeed, BP lost all pressure as it drilled into the formation.

WB: Is it possible that this fractured, subsea salt geology will make it difficult to permanently kill the oil leak using relief wells?

Bea: Yes, it could. The Santa Barbara channel seeps are still leaking, decades after the oil well was supposedly capped. This well could keep leaking for years.

Scripps mapped out seafloor seeps in the area of the well prior to the blowout. Some of the natural seeps penetrate 10,000 to 15,000 feet beneath the seafloor. The oil will follow lines of weakness in the geology. The leak can travel several horizontal miles from the location of the leak.

[In other words, the geology beneath the seafloor is so fractured, with soft and unstable salt formations, that we may never be able to fully kill the well even with relief wells. Instead, the loss of containment of the oil reservoir caused by the drilling accident could cause oil to leak out through seeps for years to come. See this and this for further background].

WB: I know that you’ve previously said that you’re concerned that there might be damage to the well bore, which could make it more difficult for the relief wells to succeed.

Bea: Yes, that’s still a concern.

WB: I have heard that BP is underestimating the size of the oil reservoir (and see this). Is it possible that the reservoir is bigger than BP is estimating, and so – if not completely killed – the leak could therefore go on for longer than most assume?

Bea: That’s plausible.

WB: The chief electronics technician on the Deepwater Horizon said that the Macondo well was originally drilled in another location, but that “going faster caused the bottom of the well to split open, swallowing tools”, and that BP abandoned that well. You’ve spoken to that technician and looked into the incident, and concluded that “they damn near blew up the rig.” [See this and this].

Do you know where that abandoned well location is, and do you know if that well is still leaking?

Bea: The abandoned well is very close to the current well location. BP had to file reports showing the location of the abandoned well and the new well [with the Minerals Management Service], so the location of the abandoned well is known.

We don’t know if the abandoned well is leaking.

WB: Matthew Simmons talked about a second leaking well. There are rumors on the Internet that the original well is still leaking. Do you have any information that can either disprove or confirm that allegation?

Bea: There are two uncorroborated reports. One is that there is a leak 400 feet West of the present well’s surface location. There is another report that there is a leak several miles to the West.

[Bea does not know whether either report is true at this time, because BP is not sharing information with the government, let alone the public.]

WB: There are rumors on the Internet of huge pockets of methane gas under the well which could explode. I’ve looked into this rumor, and have come to the conclusion that – while the leak is releasing tremendous amounts of methane – there are no “pockets” of methane gas which could cause explosions. Do you have any information on this?

Bea: I have looked into this and discussed methane with people who know a tremendous amount about it. There is a lot of liquid and solid methane at the Macondo site, but no pockets of methane gas.

WB: That’s good news, indeed.

Bea: But there was one deepwater leak I worked with where tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfite were released. We had to evacuate two towns because of the risk. [I didn’t ask Dr. Bea if there were any dangerous compounds which could be formed from the interaction of the crude oil and methane with chemicals in the ocean water or dispersants].

And with the Bay Charman oil leak, more than 50% of the oil stayed below the surface of the ocean. [As I’ve previously pointed out, the US Minerals Management Service and a consortium of oil companies, including BP, found that as little as 2% of the oil which spill from deepwater wells ever makes it to the surface of the ocean. And the use of dispersant might decrease that number still further].

WB: I have previously argued that nuking the well would be a bad idea. What do you think?

Bea: [Bea agreed that nuking the well would be counter-productive. He told me a story about a leaking deepwater well that he was involved in killing. A nuclear package was on its way to the well site but – fortunately – the well stopped by itself before a nuke was deployed. I’m not sure whether this is classified information, so I won’t disclose the name of the well. Bea also discussed alternatives in the form of high-pressure, high-temperature conventional explosives, echoing what Bill Clinton said recently].

WB: Thank you for your generous time and for sharing your expertise with us, Dr. Bea.

Bea: You’re welcome.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"Top Expert: Geology is “Fractured”, Relief Wells May Fail … BP is Using a “Cloak of Silence”, Refusing to Share Even Basic Data with the Government","Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد",,[''],,,,

The IMF says that Iran cutting off oil supplies could raise crude prices 30%. War with Iran would kill the American economy. And see this and this.

So yes, this is a newsworthy economic and financial story.

American and Israeli Hawks Beat War Drums … But the People Want Peace

While the same neoconservatives who pushed the Iraq war are now loudly beating the drums of war against Iran, neither the American or Israeli people want war.

A new United Technologies/National Journal “Congressional Connection Poll,” finds that only 13% Americans think the U.S. should “take covert action against Iran such as sabotage and assassination of scientists working on their nuclear program”.

Only 17% support “tak[ing] military action against Iran, including bombing weapons facilities inside the country.”

And most Israelis are against war with Iran as well.

As University of Maryland professor of government, and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Shibley Telhami and director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes, Steven Kull, note in the New York Times:

Despite all the talk of an “existential threat,” less than half of Israelis support a strike on Iran. According to our November poll (.pdf), carried out in cooperation with the Dahaf Institute in Israel, only 43 percent of Israeli Jews support a military strike on Iran — even though 90 percent of them think that Iran will eventually acquire nuclear weapons.

Most important, when asked whether it would be better for both Israel and Iran to have the bomb, or for neither to have it, 65 percent of Israeli Jews said neither. And a remarkable 64 percent favored the idea of a nuclear-free zone, even when it was explained that this would mean Israel giving up its nuclear weapons. The Israeli public also seems willing to move away from a secretive nuclear policy toward greater openness about Israel’s nuclear facilities. Sixty percent of respondents favored “a system of full international inspections” of all nuclear facilities, including Israel’s and Iran’s, as a step toward regional disarmament.

Given that the elites who profit from war will do their best to try to pretend we must attack Iran to protect ourselves, we must all be wary of a false flag attack against Iran. Indeed, it almost seems as if some have already hinted in that direction.

Why of course the people don’t want war … But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship … Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.

It is amply clear that Senator Clinton’s and Senator Obama’s positions on the occupation of Iraq, although declared to their supporters as withdrawing our troops, is really a lesser version of stay the course put forth by the president.

Senator Clinton is more forthright in her position; at least on Face the Nation, she does not hesitate to state we will be there for some time to come.

Senator Obama is less forthright. He states on his webpage he has adopted the Iraqi Study Group Plan for Withdraw of our troops. That plan is simply the one stated publicly by Senator Clinton.

In essence both Senators would keep our troops in Iraq for an undeclared period costing more lives and treasury.

Senator Clinton's position:

On the September 23 edition of CBS' Face the Nation:

From Clinton's interview with Schieffer:

CLINTON: CLINTON:

Well, what I have voted for -- and I did it again this week -- was setting a date to get the majority of our combat troops out as much as we possibly can,

but to recognize there will be remaining missions: the counterterrorism mission against Al Qaeda in Iraq, the protection of our embassy and our civilian work force in Iraq, the continuing mission of training the Iraqi army, if the changes that [retired] General [James] Jones and his commission recommended are made. There will also, in my view, be a continuing mission with respect to the Kurds in the north. But that is a much different mission than what is currently being pursued now. So when I have voted to say that we're going to start withdrawing troops by a date certain, it has always included a recognition of these continuing responsibilities.

SENATOR OBAMA'S POSITION:

This quote is from Senator Obama’s webpage:

""Since then, Senator Obama has laid out a plan on the way forward in Iraq that has largely been affirmed by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group led by James Baker and Lee Hamilton.""

Senator Obama certainly leads you to believe he is in concurrence with the Iraq Study Group.

The Iraq study group at page 7 of its report stated:

The primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to one of supporting the Iraqi army, which would take over primary responsibility for combat operations. By the first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected developments in the security situation on the ground, all combat brigades not necessary for force protection could be out of Iraq.

At that time, U.S. combat forces in Iraq could be deployed only in units embedded with Iraqi forces, in rapid-reaction and special operations teams, and in training, equipping, advising, force protection, and search and rescue. Intelligence and support efforts would continue. A vital mission of those rapid reaction and special operations forces would be to undertake strikes against al Qaeda in Iraq. It is clear that the Iraqi government will need assistance from the United States for some time to come, especially in carrying out security responsibilities.

SENATOR EDWARDS POSITION:

Edwards believes we should completely withdraw all combat troops in Iraq within nine to ten months and prohibit permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq. After withdrawal, we should retain sufficient forces in the region to contain the conflict and ensure that instability in Iraq does not spill over into other countries, creating a regional war, a terrorist haven, or a genocide.

Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Senator John Edwards released the following statement today urging Congress to continue to stand firm on the issue of withdrawing American troops from Iraq:

""In light of Congress' recent failures to pass bills requiring the president to withdraw our troops from Iraq, I repeat my call to Congress to remain focused and steadfast.

""Congress has the power to stop this war through their Constitutional funding authority – and they should use it by tying any war funding bills to a firm deadline that would withdraw all American combat troops from Iraq. For the sake of the brave men and women in our military, Congress must not cave to President Bush.

""Congress must use every instrument available to them, including a filibuster, to pass this bill with a timetable for withdrawal. And if the president vetoes that bill, Congress should send it to him again. And they should do this as many times as it takes for the president to finally understand he cannot reject the will of the American people on this critical issue. Congress must continue to send the president the simple and clear message:

I call upon supporters of Clinton and Obama to truly demand of their candidates an explicit position on the withdraw of troops from Iraq with no bases left in Iraq, and support the call:

NO TIMELINE NO FUNDING NO EXCUSES

AND YES WE WILL FILIBUSTER TO STOP ANY BILL THAT DOES NOT HAVE A TIMELINE.

If your candidate can not do this, then you need to join the John Edwards for President 2008!

NO TIMELINE NO FUNDING NO EXCUSES

YES WE WILL FILIBUSTER TO STOP ANY BILL THAT DOES NOT HAVE A TIMELINE.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Does any doubt remain as to who needs to lead us out of Iraq?,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

NTMA's gamble...

the 3.9% Treasury Bond 2012 and



the 4.6% Treasury Bond 2016.

Natural Gas - upward?

fundamentals (firming demand/falling supply) trends indicating significant room for gas prices increases in the range closely linked, but shallower (at 70-80%) than those in oil prices. This implies trend price for gas of ca $$8-8.25 per thousand cubic feet of gas; short-run dynamics trends, indicating a ca 6% upside to gas price relative to oil price in the next 3-6 months, implying a price range of $$6.8-6.9 per thousand cubic feet.

per NTMA release today:On Tuesday 16 June, NTMA offered two bonds in the auction,Actual results are below: ""Total bids were received for €2.397 billion and it was decided to issue a total of €1 billion [as planned]. An amount of €500 million of the 4.6% Treasury Bond 2016 was issued where the total bids received were 2.5 times the amount allocated, while €500 million of the 3.9% Treasury Bond 2012 was also issued where the total bids received were 2.2 times the amount allocated. The 2016 bond was sold at an average yield of 4.755% while the 2012 bond was sold at an average yield of 3.056%.""If you look at the table above, NTMA always preferred issuing €300mln in shorter maturity bonds and €700mln in longer maturity bonds - a 30:70 split. This time around, it appears it had to borrow heavier in shorter maturity range, hence 50:50 split. And this is for 2016 bond as opposed to 2019 bond earlier. Ouch...Price spreads min-max were also relatively heavy on shorter maturity. Compare the following two screen shots: June 16th auction: spreads of 19bps on 2016 bond (2.375 pa ) and 16bps on 2012 bond (5.33 pa)May 119th auction: spreads of 37bps on 2019 bond (3.7 pa) and 5bps on 2014 bond (1 pa).Again, NTMA are doing excellent work here, but it is a tough job...Natural-gas prices have been lagging oil prices over the recent months despite the fact that gas drilling and production are on decline worldwide. This has been noted by some Irish analysts, most notably – Davy, whose June 15 quick daily note must be credited for spotting the trend first in the Irish market.Per Davy note (Caren Crowley): “The ratio of the US oil price to gas price is reaching record highs. A reversion to more normal levels requires the oil price to pull back or the gas price to rally. With the oil price looking unstoppable, it is all up to the gas price, but it is an uphill battle.” There is not much of a real in-depth analysis in the Davy note, so here are some of my thoughts on the issue.First some short-term facts:US gas prices have fallen 34% in 6 months to June 2009 and 72% off 2008 peak. In part, this is driven by demand declines. But, as Davy note states, supply capacity has been catching up on downward trajectory: “the number of rigs exploring for, and producing, gas has fallen 56% since September 2008 when it peaked at 1,606, and is at its lowest level since 2002.” This is yet to translate into actual supply cuts as “US gas inventories are abnormally high and are 22% above their five-year average.”In early April, US natural gas inventories stood at 1,650bn cubic feet in the week ended and steady, equivalent to 300 bn cf above 5 year average and 400bn above year before. Chart 1 below (courtesy of Energy Information Administration) shows that this abnormal situation has gone worse since then with gas inventories breaching the 5-year min-max range for the first time since May 2007. Now, 25%-30% of US gas production comes from relatively young wells (drilled in the last 12 months). A significant cull of drilling rigs operating today will, therefore, translate into higher demand for imports in winter 2009-2010. The number of running (producing) rigs was down to 1,039 in the week of April 1, 2009, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) - down 49% from the 2,031 level seen in mid-September 2008 -- the highest since 1980.Chart 2 shows the same over the longer period, with clear signs of seasonality and a rising trend in inventories over time. One noticeable feature here is that volatility below the trend has been declining throughout the April 2003-April 2006. Afterward, the maximal depletions of gas reserves have steadily increased through April 2008, before once again starting to decline in late 2008 through April 2009. The rate of the later decline has been so far consistent with the rate of decline in 2003-2006 period. This is exactly identical to the 4 years falling, 3 years rising and 1 year falling cycle in 1996-2002.Another feature is the lack of similar cyclicality at the maximum surplus inventories level, in other words – in peaks above the trend (dashed line). In fact, the trend here is identical (in slope) to the average trend line. Furthermore, when it comes to surplus inventories deviations, current historically high levels (for November 2008) are actually below the maximal inventories trend.The two facts together suggest that high inventories are not being driven by excessively high supply of gas (which would be consistent with abnormally low minimal inventories in around April trough and abnormally high maximal inventories in and around late Autumn).Yet another interesting feature of the data is captured in Chart 3, which clearly shows that in recent months, weekly growth rate in inventories has not fallen substantially for positive growth rates, while the rate of natural gas inventories depletion (the negative range) has declined.Given that this already accounts for seasonality and the weather effects have not been dramatically out of line, what’s going on? The answer is: twin effects of demand changes and equity markets trends are driving prices of oil, while only demand changes have been instrumental in determining the price of natural gas to date. And this is about to change...On the demand side, power gen accounts for 58% of all US gas demand and this has been falling – 6-8% down so far in 2009. It is also important to note that gas-based electricity generation in the US is concentrated in the Western Pacific states and Northern Atlantic Board states – all of which have seen serious economic pressures on demand side.But these fundamentals do not really explain the historic trend in gas prices. Futures prices for natural gas have now hit their lowest levels since 2002. Recent pricing below $$4 per million British-thermal-unit on the NYMEX, down from $$9 mbtu in Q1 2008.Again, supply-demand analysis does not explain this. Fundamentals analysis focuses on abnormally cold weather in early 2008, which pushed spot prices up and resulted in higher levels of exploration activity. Production capacity increased, but demand collapsed. Fine theory, except, recall prices are down more than 50%, although US Energy Department expects natural-gas consumption to decline by only 1.3% in 2009.And US gas prices are linked to global gas prices – which are facing significant pressure on the Russian supply side. How? In two ways:Short-term pressure is rising due to delays in pumping annual storage reserves in Ukraine – a technical issue that can derail gas supplies to Europe. Basically, the principle here is a simple one. To run gas pipe between Russia and Western Europe (the pipe transiting Ukraine), Soviets built a pressure maintenance system that requires intermediate storage facilities (positioned on Ukraine’s territory out of the Soviets’ consideration for ‘balanced regional development’ and owned by Ukraine) to be filled to capacity. This ensures that if Ukraine’s own gas purchases start depleting the pipe flow, the flow can be topped up with reserves of gas. Ukraine is broke and has no cash to pay for this gas – which it will own once it is pumped into storage. Russians are telling Ukrainians that they can’t give them a $$2bn loan for gas and are offering to split the loan between Russia and the EU. EU is refusing. So we have stalemate. Now things are getting even more complicated because Ukraine also owes Russians further $$3bn worth of cash for gas supplied to the Ukrainian consumers. In short – if gas is not pumped into storage tanks within the next 2 months, there will be serious risk of disruption of gas supplies to Europe in fall/winter 2009-2010. This in turn will lead to price increases for gas globally.Long-term pressure is also rising due to Russian gas production now shifting to the Eastern Siberian plains. Completion of the new pipeline to service China and Japan is a sign of this. The problem here is that unlike Western Siberian plains, Eastern Siberian plains have smaller gas fields, fewer developed fields and geology that is much more challenging (shale, smaller reservoirs, more complex folds and more broken folds) that the near-perfect sands of Western Siberia. Again, this signals an upside to gas prices in the longer term (I will write about this in few days in more details).So in the nutshell, future supply constraints are daunting. And these should be working in both short term and long term in the future... Again, supply is not the main driver for the abnormal situation of falling gas prices and rising inventories.So what is? One word answer is ‘oil and gas price correlations with equity markets’. In my view, it is a speculative buying of oil as a hedge against inflation and the ‘blue chip’ low risk commodity that is driving a wedge between oil prices and gas prices and simultaneously driving closer oil prices and equity prices.A series of charts below illustrate this point.Chart above shows relatively coincident long-run trends in DJIA and Oil prices that are not replicated in gas prices. This is confirmed in the scatter plot below. Here, strong correlations in oil and gas prices against DJIA occur over significantly different slope relations. If 100 points increase in DJIA index leads to a $$1.4 increase in the price of oil, the same change in DJIA index is associated with a $$0.16 rise in the price of gas. While at parity this appears to be a movement in favour of oil, given current conditions in the market (the extremely high negative correlation between price of oil and price of gas and extremely low price of natural gas) any changes in the stock markets valuations should, based on fundamentals, drive prices of gas closer to the price of oil. Expressed in current price percentage terms, table 1 below the chart shows these historically-justified price responses. Chart below illustrates what I mean by extreme correlations Notice that current correlation is:(a) within the range of -0.75-1;(b) the change in correlation between peak of June 2008 (+99.3) to today (-88.1) is the highest on record for downward adjustment. Chart above shows the replay of the oil and gas prices correlation in line with the broad equity markets. Here, while correlation between DJIA and oil prices stands at +0.78 and remains in the positive territory since September 2008, the correlation between DJIA and gas prices is at -0.57 and has moved into negative territory in May 2009.This is interesting, because the structure of gas prices to date contrasts the findings of the recent research on links between oil and gas prices. Jose A. Villar (Energy Information Administration) and Frederick L. Joutz (Department of Economics, The George Washington University) paper The Relationship Between Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices, prepared for Energy Information Administration, Office of Oil and Gas in October 2006, shows that there exist “a cointegrating relationship relating [natural gas] prices [and] the WTI and trend capturing the relative demand and supply effects over the 1989-through-2005 period. The dynamics of the relationship suggest a 1-month temporary shock to the WTI of 20 percent has a 5-percent contemporaneous impact on natural gas prices, but is dissipated to 2 percent in 2 months. A permanent shock of 20 percent in the WTI leads to a 16 percent increase in the [gas] price 1 year out all else equal.”So the lags structure implies that a temporary shock to oil price should be followed by a delayed shock to gas prices 12 months after and that the magnitude of changes in gas prices is roughly 80% of the magnitude of shock to oil price.Clearly, as table above and charts illustrate, this relationship is currently being reversed, suggesting two emerging short- and medium-term trends:Short of a W-shaped global recession risk, there is little downside pressure on gas prices in the medium term in my view.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Energy prices, Equity markets, Oil prices, Gas prices",,
7974,3275565,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/03/in-2009-45-percent-of-banks-with-assets-under-1-billion-increased-their-business-lending.html,"Thomas M. Hoenig – president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the current longest-serving regional Fed chief – said in a speech at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce summit in Washington:

During the recent financial crisis, losses quickly depleted the capital of these large, over-leveraged companies. As expected, these firms were rescued using government funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The result was an immediate reduction in lending to Main Street, as the financial institutions tried to rebuild their capital. Although these institutions have raised substantial amounts of new capital, much of it has been used to repay the TARP funds instead of supporting new lending.



On the other hand, Hoenig pointed out:

In 2009, 45 percent of banks with assets under $$1 billion increased their business lending.

45% is about 45% more than the amount of increased lending by the too big to fails.

This confirms my previous argument that the small banks will lend, if we stop the too big to fails from growing even bigger and stifling all competition:

Do we need to keep the TBTFs to make sure that loans are made? Nope. Fortune pointed out in February that smaller banks are stepping in to fill the lending void left by the giant banks’ current hesitancy to make loans. Indeed, the article points out that the only reason that smaller banks haven’t been able to expand and thrive is that the too-big-to-fails have decreased competition: Growth for the nation’s smaller banks represents a reversal of trends from the last twenty years, when the biggest banks got much bigger and many of the smallest players were gobbled up or driven under… As big banks struggle to find a way forward and rising loan losses threaten to punish poorly run banks of all sizes, smaller but well capitalized institutions have a long-awaited chance to expand. BusinessWeek noted in January: As big banks struggle, community banks are stepping in to offer loans and lines of credit to small business owners… At a congressional hearing on small business and the economic recovery earlier this month, economist Paul Merski, of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a Washington (D.C.) trade group, told lawmakers that community banks make 20% of all small-business loans, even though they represent only about 12% of all bank assets. Furthermore, he said that about 50% of all small-business loans under $$100,000 are made by community banks… Indeed, for the past two years, small-business lending among community banks has grown at a faster rate than from larger institutions, according to Aite Group, a Boston banking consultancy. “Community banks are quickly taking on more market share not only from the top five banks but from some of the regional banks,” says Christine Barry, Aite’s research director. “They are focusing more attention on small businesses than before. They are seeing revenue opportunities and deploying the right solutions in place to serve these customers.” And Fed Governor Daniel K. Tarullo said in June: The importance of traditional financial intermediation services, and hence of the smaller banks that typically specialize in providing those services, tends to increase during times of financial stress. Indeed, the crisis has highlighted the important continuing role of community banks… For example, while the number of credit unions has declined by 42 percent since 1989, credit union deposits have more than quadrupled, and credit unions have increased their share of national deposits from 4.7 percent to 8.5 percent. In addition, some credit unions have shifted from the traditional membership based on a common interest to membership that encompasses anyone who lives or works within one or more local banking markets. In the last few years, some credit unions have also moved beyond their traditional focus on consumer services to provide services to small businesses, increasing the extent to which they compete with community banks. Indeed, some very smart people say that the big banks aren’t really focusing as much on the lending business as smaller banks. Specifically since Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999, the giant banks have made much of their money in trading assets, securities, derivatives and other speculative bets, the banks’ own paper and securities, and in other money-making activities which have nothing to do with traditional depository functions. Now that the economy has crashed, the big banks are making very few loans to consumers or small businesses because they still have trillions in bad derivatives gambling debts to pay off, and so they are only loaning to the biggest players and those who don’t really need credit in the first place. See this and this. So we don’t really need these giant gamblers. We don’t really need JP Morgan, Citi, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. What we need are dedicated lenders. The Fortune article discussed above points out that the banking giants are not necessarily more efficient than smaller banks: The largest banks often don’t show the greatest efficiency. This now seems unsurprising given the deep problems that the biggest institutions have faced over the past year. “They actually experience diseconomies of scale,” Narter wrote of the biggest banks. “There are so many large autonomous divisions of the bank that the complexity of connecting them overwhelms the advantage of size.” And Governor Tarullo points out some of the benefits of small community banks over the giant banks: Many community banks have thrived, in large part because their local presence and personal interactions give them an advantage in meeting the financial needs of many households, small businesses, and agricultural firms. Their business model is based on an important economic explanation of the role of financial intermediaries–to develop and apply expertise that allows a lender to make better judgments about the creditworthiness of potential borrowers than could be made by a potential lender with less information about the borrowers. A small, but growing, body of research suggests that the financial services provided by large banks are less-than-perfect substitutes for those provided by community banks. It is simply not true that we need the mega-banks. In fact, as many top economists and financial analysts have said, the “too big to fails” are actually stifling competition from smaller lenders and credit unions, and dragging the entire economy down into a black hole.

Hoenig also pointed out in numerous other ways that the too big to fails have to shrink or financial crises will keep on happening.

So what are our political “leaders” doing?

As shown by well-known economist Simon Johnson, worse than nothing:

The indications are that some version of the Dodd bill will be presented to Democrats and Republicans alike as a fait accompli – this is what we are going to do, so are you with us or against us in the final recorded vote? *** Of course, officials are lining up to solemnly confirm that “too big to fail” will be history once the Dodd bill passes. But this is simply incorrect. *** Why exactly do you think big banks, such as JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have been so outspoken in support of a “resolution authority”? They know it would allow them to continue not just at their current size – but actually to get bigger. Nothing could be better for them than this kind of regulatory smokescreen. This is exactly the kind of game that they have played well over the past 20 years – in fact, it’s from the same playbook that brought them great power and us great danger in the run-up to 2008. When a major bank fails, in the years after the Dodd bill passes, we will face the exact same potential chaos as after the collapse of Lehman. And we know what our policy elite will do in such a situation – because Messrs. Paulson, Geithner, Bernanke, and Summers swear up and down there was no alternative, and people like them will always be in power. If you must choose between collapse and rescue, US policymakers will choose rescue every time – and probably they feel compelled again to concede most generous terms “to limit the ultimate cost to the taxpayer” (or words to that effect). The banks know all this and will act accordingly. You do the math. Once you understand that the resolution authority is an illusion, you begin to understand that the Dodd legislation would achieve nothing on the systemic risk and too big to fail front. On reflection, perhaps this is exactly why the sponsors of this bill are afraid to have any kind of open and serious debate. The emperor simply has no clothes.

Indeed, Johnson has previously said that recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform, and he has called the U.S. a banana republic.

High-level Fed officials – including Hoenig – agree.

Congress and the White House won’t do anything to stand up to the oligarchs because they are fully bought and paid for . The oligarchy is trying to make us serfs, and our politicians (with a few notable exceptions) are helping.

Remember, it is the government which created the too big to fails. Now, politicians are covering for them with legislation that sounds good … but really just helps the too big to fails get even bigger.

Unless the people confront the oligarchs directly (plus stop feeding the tapeworm), the nation will be lost.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"“In 2009, 45 Percent of Banks with Assets Under $$1 Billion Increased Their Business Lending”","Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد",,[''],,,,

Senator Edwards it makes me and I am sure many others very nervous about your commitment when you equivocate on this issue. It also makes me very nervous when you say we need troops to protect our embassy and humanitarian workers.

Why would we want to complete an embassy that surely will become a symbol of the destruction of Iraq and hatred by Muslims? Why would we want to complete or an embassy at the cost of one billion dollars rivaling the size of Vatican City. Why would we build an embassy on 104 acres, six times larger than the United Nations compound in New York? Why would we want to complete an embassy which is a modern day fortress in the middle of Iraq if we don’t plan on occupying the country for many years to come?

I CAN'T MAKE THAT COMMITTMENT.

SEPTEMBER 27, 2007

CONGRESS APPROVES SPENDING BILL FOR IRAQ WAR

Congress Quietly Approves Billions More for Iraq War by John Nichols - THE NATION

The Senate agreed on Thursday to increase the federal debt limit by $$850 billion — from $$8.965 trillion to $$9.815 trillion — and then proceeded to approve a stop-gap spending bill that gives the Bush White House at least $$9 billion in new funding for its war in Iraq.

Additionally, the administration has been given emergency authority to tap further into a $$70 billion ""bridge fund"" to provide new infusions of money for the occupation while the Congress works on appropriations bills for the Department of Defense and other agencies.

Translation: Under the guise of a stop-gap spending bill that is simply supposed to keep the government running until a long-delayed appropriations process is completed — probably in November — the Congress has just approved a massive increase in war funding.

The move was backed by every senator who cast a vote, save one.

Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold, the maverick Democrat who has led the fight to end the war and bring U.S. troops home from Iraq, was on the losing end of the 94-1 vote. (The five senators who did not vote, all presidential candidates who are more involved in campaigning than governing, were Democrats Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden and Republicans John McCain and Sam Brownback.)

Said Feingold, ""I am disappointed that we are about to begin the 2008 fiscal year without having enacted any of the appropriations bills for that year. I am even more disappointed that we voted on a continuing resolution that provides tens of billions of dollars to continue the misguided war in Iraq but does not include any language to bring that war to a close. We need to keep the federal government operating and make sure our brave troops get all the equipment and supplies they need, but we should not be giving the President a blank check to continue a war that is hurting our national security.""

In the House, the continuing resolution passed by a vote of 404 to 14, with 14 other members not voting.

The ""no"" votes in the House, all cast by anti-war members, came from one Republican, Ron Paul of Texas, and 13 Democrats: Oregon’s Earl Blumenauer, Missouri’s William Clay, Minnesota’s Keith Ellison, California’s Bob Filner, Massachusetts’ Barney Frank, New York’s Maurice Hinchey, Ohio’s Dennis Kucinich, Washington’s Jim McDermott, New Jersey’s Donald Payne, California’s Barbara Lee, Maxine Waters, Diane Watson and Lynn Woolsey.

http://www.commondreams.org/...

ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANIDATES SAVE DENNIS KUCINICH WERE MISSING IN ACTION ON THIS INCLUDING JRE. NO ONE STOOD UP AND ATTEMPTED TO BLOCK THE FUNDING. POLITICS AS USUAL!

Senator Edwards for Memorial Day you stated we need to do extraordinary things to stop the war. What extraordinary measures do you propose at this time? What has changed since Memorial Day? I hate to say it but Where's the beef! I have been watching this for the last week and the heart of your campaign is being eroded away by the lack of commitment. You can still lead on this but time is short. I hope you make the right choices not only for this campaign but more so for the men and women (several hundred that will die in Iraq because no one has stood up and said NO YOU SHALL NOT PASS!

Why anyone cares what Gov. Perry thinks is beyond me, but when asked in a recent interview about Texas going blue, he laughed and dismissed such talk as

""the biggest pipedream I have ever heard.""

“It’s because of freedom,” he says. “People in Texas truly aspire to freedom. They don’t want government coming in and telling them how much of this or how much of that.”

7983,3275576,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,http://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/e-learning,"Here comes the second post on OECD Internet Economy Outlook 2012 report (first in the series was here ), focusing on Ireland and the mythology of our 'global ICT services hub'.So wading deeper into the OECD report, take a look at this chart:Ireland hardly can boast of an advanced fibre infrastructure that would be consistent with real ICT economy, especially ICT services economy. Per OECD: ""Fibre-based broadband connections offer the fastest data transfers...""

I grew up at a time in American history where school children were taught that people in the Soviet Union could not grow food without the express permission of the government and we made fun of the Russians.

Now the United States is stating that its citizens may not grow food without the express permission of the government. The daily news media is replete with stories of government harassment against individuals attempting to grow their own food.



No Veggies for You

The USDA’s Rural Development Agency take pleasure in bullying the young and the handicapped as they are forbidding Rosie, a 4-year-old girl, from South Dakota, from planting green vegetables in an unused area outside her subsidized housing unit.

Rosie and her mom live on a fixed income disability payment of $$628 per month. The garden vegetables growing just outside her backdoor was created to help provide a much needed boost to their food supply.

No Chickens for You

From Glendale, AZ., a posting on Phoenix’s permaculture message board revealed the following development in which a man cannot raise chickens nor can this resident possess food-bearing plants. Welcome to Agenda 21.

I just got notice that I must get rid of my 3 chickens, chicken coop and garden and remove unripe fruit from my orange tree since my lot is not zoned for agriculture. Yes, I got notified that my garden and any food bearing plants are not allowed. My orange tree can stay as long as I remove all the unripe fruit from it. I must rip up my garden and my grapevines. I live near 63rd and Kings.

The lady at neighborhood services said none of the above are allowed. I asked about the garden and grapevines and she said food bearing plants attract pests and rodents and are not allowed in residential areas of Glendale. Orange trees are allowed as long as the fruit is not allowed to ripen. All unripe fruit has to be removed and disposed of. I was told I could join a community garden if I want to grow my own food. I think Glendale is starting to get desperate for making money. She said the fine if I do not comply will be over $$2000 per violation with up to six months imprisonment and community service.

My question to the City of Glendale is “What difference does it make?”

No Fresh Goats Milk for You!

Don’t ever let the authorities know that you feed your baby healthy homemade baby formula instead of the establishment’s cancer-causing, GMO-laced commercial formula.

Alorah Gellerson of Brooklin, Maine is experiencing federal persecution because she was discovered feeding fresh goats milk to her three-month old son, Carson.

Gellerson complied with all government demands by no longer feeding her baby goats milk and substituting GMO-laced milk. However, the authorities are still threatening to remove her son.

No Food for You America!

The lessons of history clearly demonstrate that dictatorial regimes will not hesitate to use food as a weapon against their own people in order to solidify power and impose absolute autocratic control. Food can be withheld from the masses by preventing it from being grown and harvested, by contaminating it and rendering it unfit for human consumption or by simply preventing food from being distributed to a targeted population.

The two most notable examples of dictators using food a weapon in order to destroy the free will of their people comes from the regime of Stalin.

Josef Stalin engaged in his own Soviet-style Holocaust when, in 1932 and 1933, an estimated six to 20 million people in the Ukraine died from starvation when Stalin implemented his prescription of “hope and change” policies in order to eliminate the Ukrainian’s desire for becoming their own nation-state.

Upon assuming power, the Stalinist Communist regime rapidly nationalized the food industry and forced all of the region’s farms into collectives. Thus, Stalin’s version of the Holocaust came to fruition in what history has dubbed, the “Holdomor,” in which millions perished in only a two-year period when the Soviet government began to exterminate the Ukrainian population by taking control of food and food production.

Third world population control, using food as one of the primary weapons, has long been a matter of official covert national policy and a portion of President Obama’s Executive Order (EO 13603), National Defense Resources Preparedness is a continuation of that policy. Only now, the intended targets are not the countries of the Third World, but instead, the target is you and me.

With the stroke of his pen, Obama has total and absolute control over all food where his EO states:

e) “Food resources” means all commodities and products, (simple, mixed, or compound), or complements to such commodities or products, that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals, irrespective of other uses to which such commodities or products may be put, at all stages of processing from the raw commodity to the products thereof in vendible form for human or animal consumption. “Food resources” also means potable water packaged in commercially marketable containers, all starches, sugars, vegetable and animal or marine fats and oils, seed, cotton, hemp, and flax fiber, but does not mean any such material after it loses its identity as an agricultural commodity or agricultural product.

(f) “Food resource facilities” means plants, machinery, vehicles (including on farm), and other facilities required for the production, processing, distribution, and storage (including cold storage) of food resources, and for the domestic distribution of farm equipment and fertilizer…”

This unconstitutional EO is particularly disturbing in that it clearly states that the government has control over anything that is “capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals…” If you thought that you and Fido were going to get through the coming food crisis by storing and consuming dog food, think again.

How will farmers maintain the nation’s food supply when all fertilizer, their farm equipment and all of their vehicles are under the control of this sociopathic President or the next power-hungry President?

The term “all food storage facilities” includes your refrigerator, your pantry and even the very food in your cabinets as well as what is on your kitchen table. In short, anywhere you keep food is now under the control of the government and can be redistributed.

Conclusion

The government is getting us right where they want us in which they will control all food and, as a result, they will completely control us. And it is coming none to soon for them as we prepare to invade Syria and then Iran. Martial law will surely follow and food control will be the primary weapon used against Americans. More on the coming war with Syria and the impending martial law in the next part of this series.

His argument for this is that ""Ireland is highly competitive (second best in EMU after Finland on the World Bank gauge)."" The problem, of course, is that WB competitiveness indicator is superficial - it hardly reflects the reality on the ground when it comes to credit supply (non-existent in the economy, yet highly ranked in WB study), openness of domestic markets (not measured), access to public procurement (not measured), extent of domestic indirect taxes (not measured), security of domestic property rights (pensions or insurance contracts, anyone?), etc etc etc. AEP argues correctly that Ireland has high levels of exposure to international trade. And this is sustaining the macro-level recovery in the economic aggregates (GDP etc), but this has virtually no effect on the ground - the domestic economy is stagnant and most of the improvements that do take place are down to Malthusian contraction: emigration, jobs destruction, tax and charges hikes, rip-off via state-controlled prices and other measures that continue to shift private sector resources to fund the Exchequer. Ireland has had virtually no real reforms in the way domestic (public and private) business is conducted. AEP acknowledges some of the above problems, saying that ""But even if Ireland can make it without debt restructuring (and that is not certain), the underlying erosion of the workforce through hysteresis from mass unemployment – and from mass migration to the UK, US, and Australia – has greatly damaged the long-term growth potential of the economy."" This is spot on. One qualifier, however - Ireland already had three rounds of debt restructuring: two rounds of restructuring Troika debts (terms extensions and rate reductions) and one round of restructuring banks-linked debt (Promissory Notes). These provided, in some cases real and in some temporary, relief to the fiscal funding side of the equation. It is, however, in no way certain that we will not need more restructuring.

A very good article by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard on the fallacy of European 'leaders' view of the peripheral countries economic stabilisation: http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100026365/barroso-triumphant-as-jobless-europe-wastes-five-precious-years-of-global-recovery/ Some caveats:Key is that AEP 100% correct in saying that:""At the end of the day, Ireland was forced by the EU authorities to take on the vast liabilities of Anglo-Irish to save the European banking system in the white heat of the Lehman crisis, and the EU has since walked away from its pledge to help make this good. The Irish people have been stoic, disciplined, even heroic. They have survived this mistreatment. To cite it as a vindication of EU strategy sticks in the craw.""And per future, I couldn't have said it better myself:""Europe is one external shock away from a full-blown deflation trap, and one recession away from an underlying public and private debt crisis. Nothing has been resolved. Aggregate debt ratios are higher than they were before the austerity experiment. In the end there will still have to be a ""Brady Plan"" like the Latin American debt write-offs at the end of the 1980s, but on a far larger scale and with far more traumatic effects on the European body politic. So celebrate today while the sun is still out, and dream on.""Let me add that Europe is one internal shock away from the above too. All that is needed is a massive wave of financial repression to derail the common currency's faltering monetary structure and push the banking sector back into contraction. The debt levels - private and public - are dramatic enough for the economy to succumb to either external or internal shocks.

Key quote (emphasis is mine): “For the first time since the creation of Europe’s monetary union, a member state has taken the explicit step ofeurosceptic parties from taking office on the grounds of national interest.

Yet the reality is that Mr. Cavaco Silva has acted fully in accordance with the constitution, which gives the directly elected president wide discretion in the appointment of the prime minister.”And another fact that is beyond any doubt: Portugal’s electorate is split.

September 4, 2013

Bad news emerged from the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan’s northeast this week as TEPCO—-the Tokyo Electric Power Company that owns and operates the plant—-admitted discovering four areas of high radiation near the storage tanks where radioactive water is being held. Although two of the hotspots had already been known, the latest results found that the radiation readings were 18 times higher than previously measured. Headlines in numerous mainstream publications have asserted this is an 1800% jump in radiation at the site, but in fact it may be much worse. The equipment that was used to test the hotspots previously was only capable of measuring up to 100 mSv/hour of radiation, and consequently registered the radioactive areas as being 100 mSv/hr. When equipment was brought in capable of reading up to 10,000 mSv/hour, it was discovered that the areas were actually emitting 1800 mSv/hour of radiation, a dose large enough to kill an exposed human in four hours. It has since risen to a record 2200 mSv/hour. Japanese law limits radiation exposure for nuclear workers to 50 mSv/year.

This is only the latest setback for the plant. Since May, levels of radioactive tritium in the seawater surrounding Fukushima have been steadily rising, reaching their highest readings yet in mid-August. Then late last month TEPCO admitted that a storage tank had leaked 300 tons of water that was emitting an unprecedented 80 million Becquerels of radiation per litre, compared to the norm of 150 Bq. Although the Japanese Nuclear Regulatory Authority originally classified the leak a “Level One” or “anomalous” event on the International Nuclear Event Scale, they were forced to immediately raise that to “Level Three” or “serious radiation incident” when the scale of the leak became apparent.

Now the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, Shunichi Tanaka, is adding fuel to the fire. Commenting on the enormous amounts of radioactive water that continue to be generated at the plant on a daily basis, Tanaka admitted earlier this week that “I’m afraid that it is unavoidable to dump or release the water into the sea,” adding that the water currently being stored on site will be discharged into the ocean once it has been purified to levels that are recognized as “safe” under international standards. Now the Japanese government is planning to commit $$473 million to the clean-up efforts, including building an underground “ice wall” to attempt to stop contaminated water from the melted reactors mixing with the groundwater around the plant.

Meanwhile, a ban on fishing off the coast of Fukushima has been reinstated after being lifted last year. This comes on the back of more worrying reports that 6 more children in Fukushima Prefecture were diagnosed with thyroid cancer since May, bringing the total to 18 since the crisis began.

Now, in one of the latest signs of how thoroughly the situation has been mishandled, a group of Fukushima residents are suing the Japanese government for failing to provide medical and housing assistance that had been promised by law last year. The aid was supposed to be delivered to those living in zones of high radiation that were not designated as evacuation zones, but the 19 plaintiffs are alleging that the government has not even drawn up the guidelines necessary to deliver the assistance.

7996,3275590,commondreams.org,political,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2011/03/23/spewing-meltdowns-dangerous-plumes-disinformation,"Well-reported plumes of radiation have spread to California and beyond from the wrecked six-reactor complex at Fukushima, Japan. What’s worse in terms of citizen awareness, clouds of disinformation are circling even faster.

The consequences of Japan’s disaster cubed — earthquakes, a tsunami and spewing radiation — can hardly be exaggerated, with over 22,000 people reportedly killed or missing, widespread contamination by long-lasting isotopes like cesium, and an early estimate of $$250 billion in damages.

Yet within the blizzard of radiation being dispersed uncontrollably, day after day, from Japan’s wrecked reactors and their dry pools of burning-hot waste fuel, it’s important to note the storm of reassuring but erroneous lullabies about “safe,” “harmless” and “less than dangerous” exposures.

There is no level of radiation exposure, no matter how small, that is harmless. Every federal agency that regulates radioactive pollution agrees.

Any exposure raises cancer risk

The National Council on Radiation Protection says, “… every increment of radiation exposure produces an incremen­tal increase in the risk of cancer.” The Environmental Protection Agency says, “… any exposure to radiation poses some risk, i.e. there is no level below which we can say an exposure poses no risk.” The Department of Energy says about “low levels of radiation” that “… the major effect is a very slight increase in cancer risk.” The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says, “any amount of radiation may pose some risk for causing cancer ... any increase in dose, no matter how small, results in an incremental increase in risk.” The National Academy of Sciences, in its “Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII,” says, “... it is unlikely that a threshold exists for the induction of cancers ....”

Long story short, “One can no longer speak of a ‘safe’ dose level,” as Dr. Ian Fairlie and Dr. Marvin Resnikoff said in their report “No dose too low,” in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

But when representatives from government agencies, universities or industry say “the amount of radiation did not reach a dangerous level,” the listener is led to believe in error that there’s some level that is risk-free.

The hiding or obscuring of radiation’s dispersal came from government and company officials early on who reported “venting of hydrogen gas,” and claimed there was “no threat to health.” Even when hydrogen gas explosions destroyed parts of four reactors, the promise of safety was repeated.

“In fact,” writes environmental anthropologist Barbara Rose Johnston in the March 18 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, “the hydrogen released is tritium water vapor, a low-level [radiation] emitter that can be absorbed in a human body through simply breathing, or by drinking contaminated water.”

Principle Japanese government spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, has been one of the worst violators. On March 21, Edano asked the public not to overreact to reports of radioactively contaminated food, saying, “Even if you eat contaminated vegetables several times, it will not harm your health at all,” the BBC reported.

Spinach with radioactive iodine 27 times the government-established limit had been found in the city of Hitachi, more than 50 miles south of the failed reactors.

Outright lying, appalling laziness

On March 17, when radiation levels were reportedly 300 times normal just south of Fukushima, Associated Press writer Eric Talmadge reported without qualification that officials said, “It would take three years of constant exposure to these higher levels to raise a person’s risk of cancer.” This is outright lying by “officials” of course, but it also shows the appalling laziness of the AP, since information on low dose exposures is easily available from the websites of the agencies quoted above.

Dr. Chris Busby, a founder of the European Committee on Radiation Risk, and chief scientist at the Low-Level Radiation Campaign declared March 16, “Reassurances about radiation exposures issued by the Japanese government cannot be believed. They are based on an invalid risk model which the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) itself has admitted cannot be applied in accident situations.”

This ICRP radiation risk model is the basis of and dominates all present radiation exposure legislation. Yet Dr. Busby reports, “The basic concept of radiation dose is generally recognized to be invalid for many types of internal exposure relevant to the present emergency.”

Industry watchdogs are working to correct the errors. Mary Olson, of Nuclear Information and Resource Service writes, “Radiation carries a risk, not a certainty, of DNA damage at every level of exposure. An emission from a radionuclide that chanced to ride on your sandwich into your tummy — an exposure so tiny that it would never be measured — has the capacity to start what might become fatal cancer.”

Governments have set up “permissible,” “allowable” and “legal” radiation exposure limits because reactors can’t operate without venting or dumping contaminated gases and liquids. Exposure to this radiation, during routine operations or from partial meltdowns — say in milk, tap water, or vegetables — is never safe. It is merely permitted under law.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Spewing from Meltdowns: Dangerous Plumes of Disinformation,,,"['', '', '']","Well-reported plumes of radiation have spread to California and beyond from the wrecked six-reactor complex at Fukushima, Japan.

7998,3275592,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,http://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/Germany%20and%20Ireland,"By any measure, last Sunday's German elections highlighted a resounding failure of the country electorate to connect with reality. Despite returning a number of historical outcomes, the voters reaffirmed the passive-conservative leadership mandate exercised by Angela Merkel since 2009. As the result, German policies are now likely to drift even farther away from the immediate needs of the euro area periphery, risking a renewal of the euro area crisis and a slowdown in the already less-than ambitious speed of European reforms. None of this is good news for Ireland.The historical nature of the 2013 German elections is highlighted by the fact that Angela Merkel became the first euro area leader to be reelected as the head of state since the beginning of the Great Recession. And she has done it twice: first some 12 months into the crisis in 2009 and now 5 years from its onset. Ms. Merkel won the highest number of votes for her CDU/CSU party in 23 years. And she became the first German leader since the golden days of Konrad Adenauer back in 1961 to personally dominate the elections, instead of standing in the shadow of her party. Individually, all of these are rare events in modern German history. Taken together, they are probably unprecedented.But herein lies the problem for all of us living outside Germany. The elections of 2013 have produced a strong mandate for doing nothing new when it comes to either the euro area or the larger Union reforms. The Chancellor re-elect retook the Bundeskanzleramt on a mandate of being a 'safe pair of hands'. The campaign her party waged focused on such important topics as charging foreign drivers for using autobahns. Instead of debating the core issues faced by the EU, and the role of Germany in this mess, voters largely engaged in navel-gazing. Satisfied with their relatively well-performing economy and receding immediate danger to the euro, they endorsed the leadership devoid of ideas, alternative views and aspirations. Not surprisingly, philosopher Jurgen Habermas declared the 2013 general election campaign a ""collective failure"" of the elites.This means that the German elections left the core problems of the euro crisis unaddressed, raising the specter of renewed uncertainty about the future of the common currency area. This concern became immediately visible this week.On Monday, ECB's Mario Draghi rushed to compensate for the policy paralysis signaled out of Germany by stating that the ECB is ready to deploy a new round of quantitative easing in the form of the third Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO3). To remind you, the first two rounds of LTROs were the ECB’s ‘pre-nuclear option’ response to strategic threats to the euro area economy in late 2010-early 2011. The ‘nuclear option’ was the subsequent announcement of the stand-by quantitative easing programme, known as Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT). Mr. Draghi mentioning the prospect of renewing the LTRO scheme suggests that the ECB expects no change in euro area policies in the aftermath of last week’s elections.Acknowledging this, Draghi also tried to push aside the pesky issue of the Greek Bailout 3.0. And in a direct reflection of the Berlin’s preferences, Draghi also downplayed the possibility of the ESM being licensed to provide financing cover for future bank failures.Mr Draghi’s precautionary moves were timed perfectly. Following the elections, sovereign yields on all peripheral countries’ bonds rose relative to German bunds. Credit default swaps – insurance contracts underwriting sovereign bonds – also crept up. The markets are not buying the ‘return to status quo’ story as good news. This was contrasted by the domestic news which saw the German economic sentiment, as measured by the CESIfo index of economic conditions rise for the third month in a row. This marks fifteenth consecutive quarter of the CESIfo index reading above historical average. In contrast, euro area economic conditions index has been stuck below its historical average levels for eight quarters in a row through this September.Since 2009 elections, Chancellor Merkel held back from directly leading the euro area and instead opted repeatedly to wait for an escalation of the crises before responding with un-prepared, often ad hoc and wrong-footed solutions. Best examples of this approach to leadership are the EU's failures in Cyprus and Greece. Both are directly linked to Ms. Merkel’s prevarication in the face of escalating crises. All were driven by swings in domestic public opinion, rather than by any cohesive principles.For Ireland, this mode of leadership spells lack of progress on key issues.Gauging German public opinion there is currently zero appetite to shift away from the pre-elections status quo in which the Irish crisis is seen as largely self-induced and peripheral to German interests. This means that Germany is likely to continue supporting Irish debt sustainability rhetorically, while opposing practical resolution of the debt overhang. This week, Ms. Merkel gave another loud endorsement to Irish Government policies during the crisis. As she did so, the Irish Government – usually not known for its skeptical pragmatism – was actively pushing the timeline for banking debts problem resolution out into the later months of 2014. My gut feeling is that we can expect this timeline to stretch beyond 2015. Instead of allowing restructuring of our banking debts, Berlin will nod approvingly to a precautionary line of credit for Ireland via set-aside stand-by facility at the ESM. This credit will be provided on current ESM funding terms, some 1 percent below the cost of IMF funding and with longer maturities. Which is the good news.In exchange for this token gesture we will be required to strictly adhere to fiscal adjustment targets for 2015. We will be further subjected to a new multi-annual fiscal programme stretching into 2018-2020 to be supervised by the EU Commission. ECB – by proxy, the German government – will be watching from the shadows.Meanwhile, as Mr. Draghi statement this week indicates, Germany will block ESM from having any powers in dealing with future banking crises. Our retrospective banks debt deal will then have to wait until a new funding facility, most likely administered by the ECB, comes into place. Pencil that for sometime in 2016. Pushing legacy debts incurred by the Exchequer as the result of rescuing our banks into the hands of the ECB is likely to cost us. Frankfurt can, and potentially will, demand something in return for this. One thing the ECB can ask for is accelerated sales of the Central Bank-held Government bonds (the fallout from the Promissory Notes deal done earlier this year). The ECB already has the power to do so. It also has a direct incentive: the bonds are set against our banks borrowings from the euro system. Of course, this will mean that we will be trading one debt for another, as accelerated sales of bonds will erode the temporary fiscal ‘savings’ achieved by the Promo Notes restructuring.But the cost of the EU/German ‘assistance’ for Ireland will most likely extend further than bonds sales acceleration and new fiscal targets setting. German political agenda is well-anchored to continued saber-rattling on the need for corporate tax harmonization across the EU. With the 2009-2011 Franco-German tax harmonisation initiative all but dead, the focus in the next two-three years will shift toward advancing the consolidated common corporate tax base (CCCTB) proposals that suit German interests more than any other form of tax coordination. Based on her record to-date, Ms. Merkel is a fan of the CCCTB as are all of her potential coalition partners and the German voters.German elections are also promising to create less certainty as to the structural reforms in the European Union space. Last Sunday’s results produced strong votes for the anti-euro party, Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD). The party also did well in the previously held local elections. The new Merkel-led coalition will have to show caution when facing any prospect of further harmonisation and consolidation of power in Brussels.When it comes to structural reforms, German public prefers for euro area to focus on specific hard fiscal targets and on replicating Germany's own structural reforms of the 1990s. While such reforms can be beneficent to the euro area peripheral states, for Ireland they offer only marginal gains. German reforms of the 1990s have focused on two core policy pillars: increasing flexibility of the labour markets and decreasing the burden of the welfare state. These came at a cost of continued consolidation of German economy around larger enterprises and suppression of domestic demand and household investment.Ireland today requires some reforms in the social welfare system. But we also need to break up our dominant market players in the domestic sectors and to increase our households’ spending and investment.In short, in the wake of the German elections, there is preciously little that Ireland can expect in terms of the European support for our recovery. Europe, with German blessing, will most likely lend us a hand to help us out of the 'safe' boat of the Troika programme. Thereafter, swimming in the turbulent waters of the Eurozone crisis will be up to us. Let's hope Budget 2014 provides generously for flotation vests.Marking the fifth anniversary of the Banking Guarantee of September 2008, there are plenty of stocktaking exercises going around. Yet, for all the ‘Fail’ marks being rightly handed out to the Guarantee, all signs in the streets suggest we have learned next to nothing from our past errors. This week offers at least two such examples. Firstly, the crisis showed that a non-transparent system of monitoring and managing financial risks will result in the connected-few gaming the entire system. This week, Minister Noonan intervened in the process of winding down the IBRC, bending the rules that normally apply to company liquidations. Granting anonymity to the funders of the toxic banks comes as a priority in this country. Unintended consequence of this is that it also perpetuates the cronyist relationship between the financial services and the state – exactly the outcome we should have learned to avoid. Secondly, we know that principles-based regulations require swift, robust and unambiguous enforcement. Also this week, the Central Bank effectively shut the door on any further investigations into Anglo dealings with the regulators that could have arisen from the infamous Anglo Tapes. Five years in, there are zero prosecutions, and scores of closed investigations.

Last Sunday’s results produced strong votes for the anti-euro party, Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD). The party also did well in the previously held local elections. The new Merkel-led coalition will have to show caution when facing any prospect of further harmonisation and consolidation of power in Brussels.When it comes to structural reforms, German public prefers for euro area to focus on specific hard fiscal targets and on replicating Germany's own structural reforms of the 1990s. While such reforms can be beneficent to the euro area peripheral states, for Ireland they offer only marginal gains. German reforms of the 1990s have focused on two core policy pillars: increasing flexibility of the labour markets and decreasing the burden of the welfare state. These came at a cost of continued consolidation of German economy around larger enterprises and suppression of domestic demand and household investment.Ireland today requires some reforms in the social welfare system. But we also need to break up our dominant market players in the domestic sectors and to increase our households’ spending and investment.In short, in the wake of the German elections, there is preciously little that Ireland can expect in terms of the European support for our recovery. Europe, with German blessing, will most likely lend us a hand to help us out of the 'safe' boat of the Troika programme. Thereafter, swimming in the turbulent waters of the Eurozone crisis will be up to us. Let's hope Budget 2014 provides generously for flotation vests.Marking the fifth anniversary of the Banking Guarantee of September 2008, there are plenty of stocktaking exercises going around. Yet, for all the ‘Fail’ marks being rightly handed out to the Guarantee, all signs in the streets suggest we have learned next to nothing from our past errors. This week offers at least two such examples. Firstly, the crisis showed that a non-transparent system of monitoring and managing financial risks will result in the connected-few gaming the entire system. This week, Minister Noonan intervened in the process of winding down the IBRC, bending the rules that normally apply to company liquidations. Granting anonymity to the funders of the toxic banks comes as a priority in this country. Unintended consequence of this is that it also perpetuates the cronyist relationship between the financial services and the state – exactly the outcome we should have learned to avoid. Secondly, we know that principles-based regulations require swift, robust and unambiguous enforcement. Also this week, the Central Bank effectively shut the door on any further investigations into Anglo dealings with the regulators that could have arisen from the infamous Anglo Tapes. Five years in, there are zero prosecutions, and scores of closed investigations. To paraphrase Bon Jovi’s famous refrain: the less we learn, the more things stay the same…",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","ECB, Irish banking crisis, OMT, Irish economy, 2008 Guarantee, Anglo, EU Commission, Euro area periphery, EU report, Irish Independent, German economy, Merkel, Lenihan, Banks Guarantee, German elections, Euro area crisis, Banking Guarantee, Irish Guarantee, Adjustment Programme, Germany and Ireland, Trichet",,

All the birds that have been tested by vets so far were found to be starving and emaciated.

One theory is insufficient predatory fish to herd baitfish inland for the birds to feed on, but as Youtuber Pinksapphiret2 asks at the end of her video report above, “Is it a lack of baitfish or is it radiation?”

Or is the radiation ultimately causing the lack of baitfish?

The video’s narrator is surely referring to the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant on the coast of Japan which still spills 400 tons of irradiated groundwater a day, every day, into the Pacific Ocean and has since it was struck by an earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011.

While the mainstream media continues to play off the Fukushima disaster and the Japanese government and mostly government-owned TEPCO, the power company which owns the plant, continue to reassure everyone that everything is under control and the irradiated water is just hanging out in the bay in front of the plant (the most absurdly unbelievable story maybe in the history of ever), it would seem we are all somehow supposed to believe that the ocean is basically a giant Mr. Clean Magic Eraser for all of this radiation and that it will not have any real or far-reaching consequences on the delicate balance of the biosphere.

We are supposed to believe this and go back to whatever it was we were doing, even as more and more reports of radiation-tainted wildlife, contaminated foodstuffs and mass animal illnesses and die-offs surrounding Pacific coastal areas continue to be reported seemingly every other day.

If the questions above were asked of Yachtsman Ivan Macfadyen, who sailed from Melbourne to Osaka and then on to San Francisco earlier this year and noted how quiet the ocean was most of the voyage due to the lack of seabirds, he would straight up answer “The ocean is broken”.

8003,3275598,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,http://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/IMF%20and%20Euro%20area,"So having penned the G20 response to the euro area crisis (see post here ) last night, tonight, IMF decided to issue another missive on the topic ( here ). Which makes you wonder if the IMF has become so frustrated with the euro area's lack of real leadership, it has now resorted to the tactic known as blanket bombing the EU with gloomy assessments.





Here are some interesting extracts [comments and emphasis are mine]:





""Downward spirals between sovereigns, banks, and the real economy are stronger than ever.





As concerns about banks’ solvency have increased—because of large sovereign exposures and weak growth prospects in many parts of the euro area—the effectiveness of liquidity operations has diminished. [It is clear that the IMF is seeing the entire euro area response policy as a set of liquidity supply measures, rather than solvency and structural reforms set of measures.]





Sovereigns, in turn, are struggling to backstop weak banks on their own. Absent collective mechanisms to break these adverse feedback loops, the crisis has spilled across euro area countries. Contagion from further intensification of the crisis—including acute stress in funding markets and tensions involving systemically-important banks—would be sizeable globally. And spillovers to neighboring EU economies would be particularly large.





A more determined and forceful collective response is needed.""





So far so good. In the nutshell, the IMF is saying that the euro crisis is now threatening the EU itself. In other words, were some nut eurosceptic to invent a tool for undermining the EU, he couldn't have done much better than inventing the current euro zone.





So what are the IMF proposals for the euro area more forceful collective response? Why, of course it is integrate more and grow.





""Completing EMU: Banking and Fiscal Union to Support Integration





A strong commitment toward a robust and complete monetary union would help restore faith in the viability of EMU . This should encompass a credible path to a banking union and greater fiscal integration, with better governance and more risk sharing. However, achieving this goal will take time and hence requires a clear timeline, with concrete intermediate actions to set the guide posts and anchor public expectations.""





Err... Mr IMF, I have a question: suppose we have a banking union. Which means all banks will be regulated under singular umbrella. Note - this does not mean having a proper regime for shutting down currently insolvent banks, nor does it mean a unified system of banks assets workout. It means, however, joint deposits protection scheme. Good thing, deposits protection. Confidence improving. Alas, last time I checked, Greek banks are sick because of the sick sovereign, bonds of which they hold & of the sick economy. Spanish and Irish banks are sick because they made bad loans. In all cases so far, banks are sick not because they lack regulatory unification, and not because they lack deposits protection, but because they have bad assets. How can a banks union make these assets any better?





Good news, IMF says: "" The proposed EU framework for harmonized national bank resolution processes is a necessary first step. But it needs to go further. ...A common bank resolution authority is also needed. It should be backed by a common resolution fund to ensure burden sharing and to limit fiscal costs. These efforts should be supported by a common supervisory and macro-prudential framework to forestall further financial fragmentation. While a banking union is desirable at the EU27 level, it is critical for the euro 17.""





Bad news: there are absolutely no proposals even discussed yet to cover banks resolution mechanism. IMF is exceptionally silent on what should be done to achieve such 'resolution' and EU has shown no willingness to allow shutting down of a single bank. Thus, common resolution mechanism in the IMF parlance means preciously little, but in the EU vocabulary it means simply 'burden sharing'. In other words, 'banks resolution' mechanism is more about shafting bad banks debt onto all of the euro zone collectively. While this might help individual countries, e.g. Ireland, it does nothing to change the reality that euro area combined Government debt is going to be 90% of GDP this year alone. In other words, relabeling, for example, Irish banks debt an EA17 debt, instead of the Irish Government debt, will not achieve any net improvement in terms of breaking the links between banks and sovereigns (the sovereign here, thus becomes EA17 instead of national) and it will do absolutely nothing to restore functioning banking in EA17.





My suggestion would be for IMF to be more forthright and tell exactly what this 'resolution mechanism' should look like.









IMF goes on with lofty dreamin:





"" More fiscal integration, with risk sharing supported by stronger governance , can reduce the tendency for economic shocks in one country to imperil the euro area as a whole. Ultimately, this could mean sufficiently large resources at the center, matched by proper democratic controls and oversight, to help insure budget shortfalls at the national level. Getting to this endpoint will take time. But the process can start with a commitment to a broad-based dialogue about what a fuller fiscal union would imply for the sovereignty of member states and the accountability of the center. This should deliver a schedule for discussion, decision, and implementation.""





Wait, aside from the desirability of such a solution (which is open to a debate), the IMF says that the solution will take time. Lots of time. And yet, this is supposed to be a response to the ongoing acute crisis? Or does IMF honestly believe that 'a commitment to a broad-based dialogue' will do anything to compensate for the fact that euro area peripheral states are currently insolvent? How? By telling the markets that they are 'broadly-speaking talking to each other'?





I do note that the IMF is clearly stressing the need for democratic systems reforms in line with integration. I wonder, however, what they have in mind, exactly. Are they saying EU is currently not democratic enough? After all, if EU is democratic, then 'proper democratic controls and oversight' would exist already and would simply need to be deployed to a new structure...









The IMF also offers an interesting insight into its perception of the euro bonds ideas:





"" Introduction of a limited form of common debt, with appropriate governance safeguards, can provide an intermediate step towards fiscal integration and risk sharing. Such debt securities could, at first, be restricted to shorter maturities and small size and be conditional on more centralized control (e.g., limited to countries that deliver on policy commitments; veto powers over national deficits; pledging of national tax revenues). Common bonds/bills financing could, for example, be used to provide the backstops for the common frameworks within the banking union.""





Interesting, isn't it? On one hand, IMF foresees limited common debt issuance. On the other it foresees this common debt being used to 'backstop ... banking union'. Now, wait - I thought banking union backstop would have to be enough to deal with current acute problems in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. That would be what? €300 billion? €500 billion? And that would have to be 'cheaper' and 'more stable' source of funding than ECB already provides. So it cannot be 'limited' and it cannot be 'short-term' (LTROs are already €1 trillion-large and 3-years long and they are not working).









In short, I see loads of frustration from the IMF side, but no real tangible solutions to the euro are crisis.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Euro crisis, IMF and euro crisis, Euro area debt crisis, Euro area periphery, Euro area banking crisis, Article IV Euro area, IMF and Euro area, banking union, common bonds, euro area Article IV consultation, Euro area crisis, Growth crisis, Euro area austerity",,

IMF released its statement on 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Euro AreaThe Statement reads (emphasis mine):""Policy actions over the past year have addressed important tail risks and stabilized financial markets. But.""So what needs to be done, you might ask? Oh, nothing new, really. Euro area needs:-- To take ""concerted policy actions to restore financial sector health and complete the banking union"". Wait… err… this was not planned to-date? Really?-- ""continued demand support in the near term and deeper structural reforms throughout the euro area remain instrumental to raise growth and create jobs"". In other words: find some dish to spend on stuff and hope this will do the trick on short-term growth. Reform thereafter.Not exactly encouraging? How about this: ""…the centrifugal forces across the euro area remain serious and are pulling down growth everywhere. Financial markets are still fragmented along national borders and the cost of borrowing for the private sector is high in the periphery, particularly for smaller enterprises. Ailing banks continue to hold back the flow of credit."" So the solution is - more credit? Now, what did we call credit in old days? Right… debt, so: ""In the face ofand continued uncertainty, households and firms are postponing spending—previously, this was mainly a problem of the periphery but uncertainty over the adequacy and timing of the policy response is now making itself felt in falling demand in the core as well."" Wait a second, now: more credit… err… debt will solve the problem, but the problem is too much debt… err… credit from the past…Ok, from IMF own publication earlier this year, what happens when credit - debt - is let loose:Source: http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2013/03/05/a-missing-piece-in-europes-growth-puzzle/Just in case you need more of this absurdity: ""…reviving growth and employment is imperative. This requires actions on multiple fronts—repairing banks’ balance sheets, making further progress on banking union, supporting demand, and advancing structural reforms. These actions would be mutually reinforcing: measures to improve credit conditions in the periphery would boost investment and job creation in new productive sectors, which in turn would help restore competitiveness and raise growth in these economies. A piecemeal approach, on the other hand, could further undermine confidence and leave the euro area vulnerable to renewed stress."" Oh, well, 5 years ago we neededIMF is more sound on banks: ""bank losses need to be fully recognized, frail but viable banks recapitalized, and non-viable banks closed or restructured"". But, five years, bank losses needed to be fully recognised too and we are still waiting. And when it comes to closing or restructuring non-viable banks, pardon me, but where was the IMF in the case of Ireland when the country was forced by the ECB to underwrite non-viable banks with taxpayers funds?""A credible assessment of bank balance sheets is necessary to lift confidence in the euro area financial system."" Ok, we had three assessments of euro area banks - none credible and all highly questionable in outcomes. Five years in, we are still waiting for an honest, open, transparent assessment.Cutting past the complete waffle on the banking union and ESM, ""The ECB could build on existing instruments—such as a new LTRO of longer tenor coupled with a review of current collateral policies, particularly on loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)—or undertake a targeted LTRO specifically linked to new SME lending."" Ooops, I have been saying for years now that the ECB should create a long-term funding pool for most distressed banks, stretching 10-15 years. Five years into the crisis - still waiting.On structural reforms, IMF is going now broader and further than before and I like their migration:""For the euro area, …a targeted implementation of the Services Directive would remove barriers to protected professions, promote cross-border competition, and, ultimately, raise productivity and incomes. A new round of free trade agreements could provide a much-needed push to improve services productivity. In addition, further support for credit and investment could be achieved through EIB facilities. The securitization schemes proposed by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank could also underpin SME lending and capital market development."" Do note that the last two proposals are still about debt generation (see above).""At the national level, labor market rigidities [same-old] should be tackled to raise participation, address duality—which disproportionally hurts younger workers—and, where necessary, promote more flexible bargaining arrangements. At the same time, lowering regulatory barriers to entry and exit of firms and tackling vested interests in the product markets throughout the euro area would support competitiveness, as it would deliver a shift of resources to export sectors [ok, awkwardly put, but pretty much on the money. Except, greatest protectionism in the EU is accorded to banks and famers, and these require first and foremost restructuring].""In short - little new imagination, loads of old statements replays and little irony in recognising that much of this has been said before… five years before, four years before, three years before, two years before, a year before… you get my point.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Euro crisis, Euro area debt crisis, Euro area periphery, Euro area banking crisis, IMF and Euro area, euro area Article IV consultation, Euro area crisis, Growth crisis, Euro area austerity",,

Recent CEPR paper DP9541 (July 2013), titled ""Debt Crises and Risk Sharing: The Role of Markets versus Sovereigns"" by Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, Emiliano Luttini, and Bent E Sørensen (linked here: www.cepr.org/pubs/dps/DP9541.asp ) used ""a variance decomposition of shocks to GDP"", in order to ""quantify the role of international factor income, international transfers, and saving in achieving risk sharing during the recent European crisis.""Basic idea of the exercise was that a lack of saving in good times may reduce consumption smoothing in bad times, forcing households to cut back their spending and consumption more dramatically once recession hits.Under perfect risk sharing, the consumption growth of individual countries should be completely independent from all other factors, conditional on world consumption growth.The authors of the study ""calculate how much of a shock to GDP is absorbed by various components of saving, in particular government saving, and other channels, such as net foreign factor income for the sub-periods 1990-2007, 2008-2009, and 2010."" The key finding here is that ""overall, risk sharing in the EU was significantly higher during 2008-2009 than it was during the earlier period, but total risk sharing more or less collapsed in 2010."" Notably, 2010 is the year when European economies embarked on 'austerity' path, primarily and predominantly expressed (especially in the earlier stages) in tax increases. It is worth noting that there virtually no reductions in public spending during 2009 or 2010 across the EU and even in countries where spending was cut, such as Ireland, much of the reductions came from indirect taxation - e.g. transfers of health spending from public purse to private insurance.Further, the authors ""study how the crisis a affected risk sharing for ""PIIGS"" countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain), which were at the center of the sovereign debt crisis, compared to non-PIIGS countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom).""Again, the findings are revealing: ""For 1990-2009, risk sharing was mainly due to pro-cyclical government saving but the amount of risk sharing from government saving turned negative in 2010 for the PIIGS countries: government saving increased at the same time as GDP decreased."" In other words - this is the exact effect of austerity as practised by the EU periphery.""For [euro area peripheral] countries our measure of overall risk sharing turns negative because (conditional on world consumption growth) the decline in GDP in 2010 was accompanied by a more than proportional decline in consumption. This mirrors the behavior of emerging economies where government saving typically is counter-cyclical as shown by Kaminsky, Reinhart, and V egh (2005).""Crucially, the study shows that there is basically no risk-sharing mechanism that operates on the entire euro area level. Even common currency zone - via lower interest rates - does not deliver risk sharing in 2010 and has potentially a very weak effect in 2008-2009 period. Worse, for the euro area peripheral states, euro has been a mechanism that seemed to have removed risk sharing opportunities both in and out of the crisis:""…although non-PIIGS countries shared a non-negligible amount of risk during 2000{2007 while the PIIGS shared little risk in those years: in the good year 2005, consumption increased faster than GDP leading to ""negative risk sharing."" In 2008 and 2009 the major amount of GDP risk is shared for non-PIIGS with low consumption growth rates in spite of large drops in GDP, with the amount of risk shared in 2008 over 100 percent (positive consumption growth in spite of negative GDP growth). For the PIIGS, consumption declined very little in 2008 in spite of a large drop in GDP, while the drop in GDP in 2009 clearly led to declining consumption and, in 2010, consumption fell by almost as much as GDP, indicating little risk sharing."": once the authors ""decompose risk sharing from saving into contributions from government and private saving"", data reveals ""that fiscal austerity programs played an important role in hindering risk sharing during the sovereign debt crisis.""",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Ireland, PIIGS, Euro area economy, Euro area periphery, Euro area crisis, Euro area risk sharing",,

Fifty years ago, Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic presidential candidate, injected a peace proposal into his hard-fought political campaign. Speaking before the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 21, 1956, Stevenson suggested halting H-bomb tests and challenging other nations to do the same. According to the Illinois Democrat, such actions would reflect our determination never to plunge the world into nuclear holocaust and would reaffirm our purpose to act with humility and a decent concern for world opinion.

Although sharp criticism in the press and from President Dwight Eisenhower led Stevenson to shelve the issue temporarily, he revived it on September 5. Addressing the American Legion, he warned that there is not peace — real peace — while more than half of our federal budget goes into an armaments race . . . and the earth’s atmosphere is contaminated from week to week by exploding hydrogen bombs. Thereafter, his proposal to halt the nuclear arms race by ending nuclear testing became a key component of his campaign. On October 15, in a nationwide TV broadcast focused entirely on the nuclear testing issue, he pledged that, as president of the United States, he would make a nuclear test ban his first order of business.

Why did this proposal become a central issue in Stevenson’s campaign? There is little doubt that Stevenson, a humane individual with a genuine concern for human survival, sincerely believed in it.

In addition, however, making a peace proposal could be useful politically. Having lost the 1952 presidential race to Eisenhower, Stevenson recognized that his 1956 presidential campaign provided his last practicable chance to reach the White House. In the early 1950s, millions of Americans longed for peace, and Eisenhower had won the 1952 race in large part thanks to the fact that he had promised to end the Korean War, a bloody, unpopular conflict for which the Democrats received most of the blame. After his election, Eisenhower had ended the war, and now the Republicans, gearing up for his 1956 re-election campaign, were trumpeting Peace, Progress, and Prosperity as their campaign themes.

Stevenson and his campaign strategists were well aware of these facts. In 1955, responding to Stevenson’s question about how to seize the peace initiative from the Republicans, Thomas Finletter, a top aide, suggested that he attack the Eisenhower administration for bringing the nation twice to the brink of total atomic war and that he strongly make the case for disarmament. Stevenson’s willingness to adopt this approach was reinforced by a growing number of pleas for nuclear disarmament from religious groups and leaders, distinguished scientists, and the one Democratic holdover on the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Although some campaign staffers feared that a critique of nuclear testing would damage Stevenson’s 1956 campaign, others were enthusiastic about it, in part because it generated enthusiastic applause at his campaign rallies.

In addition, there was growing criticism of nuclear testing by peace and disarmament activists. One of the most prominent of them — Norman Cousins, the editor of the Saturday Review of Literature — had warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons since their public debut in 1945, brought the Hiroshima Maidens to the United States for plastic and reconstructive surgery, and had recently taken up the nuclear testing issue as the key to halting the nuclear arms race. Stevenson had a close relationship with Cousins, and repeatedly drew on him for political advice and campaign speeches. According to Stevenson, Cousins was his constant counselor and conscience.

Not surprisingly, the Republicans — as keen proponents of nuclear weapons for their new national security policy of massive retaliation — lashed back furiously at Stevenson’s nuclear test ban proposal. Vice President Richard Nixon denounced it as catastrophic nonsense. Publicly, Eisenhower assailed Stevenson for his antinuclear stand, while privately he dismissed him contemptuously as that monkey. Determined to nail Stevenson, AEC chair Lewis Strauss lined up prominent scientists to condemn the Democratic candidate and to endorse the president’s nuclear weapons policy.

The attack on Stevenson gained momentum after October 18, 1956, when Soviet premier Nikolai Bulganin sent a letter to Eisenhower criticizing the administration’s position on nuclear testing. Strauss viewed this as a windfall in view of the headway which Stevenson had made with the issue during the campaign, and suggested that if carefully handled, the note could be turned to considerable advantage. Working with Dulles and, later, with Eisenhower and other officials, Strauss helped produce a withering public response. Delivered by Eisenhower, it attacked the Soviet Union for interfering in U.S. politics. Together with Bulganin’s letter, it certainly helped to undermine Stevenson’s campaign momentum. Meanwhile, Eisenhower continued to attack Stevenson’s nuclear arms control proposal, arguing that it was vital for the United States to maintain the most advanced military weapons.

The upshot seems to have been that, although Stevenson’s call for a ban on nuclear testing added new interest and energy to his campaign, it did not deliver any substantial bloc of votes to him, either. Given Eisenhower’s immense personal popularity, plus his ability to point to Peace, Progress, and Prosperity, the Republican president won the 1956 election handily and went on to serve another four years in the White House.

Even so, in the following years, Stevenson and the Democrats could take some satisfaction in their test ban proposal. Public opposition to nuclear testing continued to grow. In 1957, Cousins organized the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, an organization that, with Cousins at its helm, spurred popular demands for nuclear arms control and disarmament. In 1958, faced with massive public pressure, at home and abroad, the Eisenhower administration accepted a Soviet-initiated moratorium on nuclear testing and began negotiations for a test ban treaty. By 1960, every major candidate for the presidency publicly supported a nuclear test ban, including Nixon. Although Stevenson was edged out for the Democratic presidential nod that year, he was appointed by the victorious Democrat, John F. Kennedy, as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In 1963, with the help of Stevenson and Cousins, the Kennedy administration negotiated and secured the ratification of the Partial Test Ban Treaty — one of its most popular measures.

This brief story provides a lesson for contemporary Democrats, now going into the 2006 midterm congressional elections. If the Soviet government had not undermined Stevenson’s call for a test ban with its clumsy behavior and if Eisenhower had not enjoyed immense personal popularity and been able to point to his own record as a Peace leader, Stevenson might well have profited politically from his 1956 peace proposal. Furthermore, in the following years the test ban issue grew increasingly popular, with the Democrats using it to help them win office, continue in power, and secure a more peaceful world. Perhaps the time has come for contemporary Democrats to stake out a peace proposal of their own and to use it just as effectively.

The above account is borrowed from an article published in The Atlantic in 1998. Back then not much was known about Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP for short. While most patients of other diseases would cringe at hearing the emotionless verbiage describing their illness, FOP patients yearned for even a hint of medical jargon to explain just what the heck was turning their muscles into bone. Terms like ""stone man's disease"" and ""a genetic Medusa's gaze"" were favorable among the media, but not so much with the patients. The press wouldn't be too keen about an obtuse and abstract medical description of FOP, but for patients it would mean that someone finally knew what genetic wire came undone, and more importantly, be able to start fixing it. It would take just over eight years from the time The Atlantic article was published before researchers would unlock the skeleton key for FOP. While eight years might seem like a lot of time to the non-scientist, considering the initial lack of interest in FOP research, eight years was fast as lightning.

* * *

Though throughout recorded medical history there have been several accounts of FOP, not much was known about the disease until the last 20 years, with a great wealth of knowledge entering the scientific literature since 2006. Despite its striking phenotype, research on FOP was almost nonexistent until the early 1990s. The lack of NIH enthusiasm likely stemmed from two lines of thought. First, early investigations into the disease were mostly of the ""trial and error"" approach, simply because very little was known about FOP, which limited the ability to construct a hypothesis-driven project. And second, the number of known patients was in the low hundreds (the disease affects approximate 1 in 2 million people), not to mention a wide range of phenotypic severity. It was the classic nightmare scenario for statisticians; and also for patients, whose hopes at living a better life were locked away in the caverns of the unknown, waiting to be explored by those with a dash of adventure and a heart of gold.

Despite the initial apathy from the NIH, two intrepid researchers decided to forge ahead on their own. Physicians Michael Zasloff and Fred Kaplan had seen dozens of FOP patients during the 1980s, and though they were the experts in the field, their advice could be no more than ways to ease the pain for those being imprisoned in a second skeleton. By the early 1990s, advances in both the scientific and patient communities had gained momentum. Just a few years prior researchers had sequenced several Bone Morphogenic Proteins (BMPs) (no small task in 1988), key proteins that initiate bone development in embryos. Separate from the laboratory, the late 1980s was a time of camaraderie and connection for those stricken with the disease, as several small meetings between FOP patients were arranged. Finally, after many years of struggle and hardship by both patients and researchers alike, the 1st Annual International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Symposium was held in 1991.

It was not long after that first symposium that the higher ups at the NIH began to take notice. In 1993, just five years after being rejected for funding, Dr. Kaplan was approved for a large grant to investigate the role of BMP in FOP pathogenesis. The timing was perfect, as Dr. Kaplan had just recruited a junior faculty member from Fox Chase Cancer Center to help co-direct the newly formed Center for FOP Research at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Kaplan and his new co-researcher, Dr. Eileen Shore, moved steadfastly to compile a team of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, and technicians all with one goal in mind - uncover as much as possible about FOP. For over a decade the team trekked along - Dr. Shore focused on biomedical research while Dr. Kaplan continued to see patients. Little by little the team assembled the FOP puzzle piece by piece.

First, they learned that BMP was most certainly involved in the disease pathogenesis, and later they narrowed it down more specifically to BMP4. Clinical observations added even more pieces to the puzzle. Though extra (heterotopic) bone formation was consistent throughout a patient's life, certain events - immunizations, infections, cuts and bruises - all led to the development of rapid lesions called ""flare-ups"". It was clear the immune system had an impact on the disease, but what or how was unknown.

Research continued at a swift pace until finally the team discovered the holy grail 16 long years after the Center for FOP Research was founded. On April 23rd, 2006, Drs. Kaplan and Shore published in Nature Genetics the gene and mutation that caused FOP:

""A recurrent mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 causes inherited and sporadic fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva""

The discovery of the FOP gene brought a lot of sense to past findings. ACVR1, the gene mutated in FOP, is a BMP4 receptor, which fit the previously known importance of BMP4 (as an aside for non-scientists, a receptor is a protein that receives molecular signals from outside a cell and transmits them within a cell).

News of discovery spread fast. On April 23rd, 2006, the same day the original paper was published in Nature Genetics, a story was featured in USA Today. Not long after that, a story about the discovery of the FOP gene made it above-the-fold in the New York Times . In the years to come, more stories would appear, even features in National Geographic and the Discovery Channel. Some would call it exploitation, others would call it awareness, but whatever you called it, the reality was the same; for patients, it finally meant a chance at a normal life. If not for them, then those who would come after. It finally meant that a wordsmith was not needed to describe their disease. It finally meant hope.

* * *

Much can be taken from the journey along the trail of FOP research, some of it novel and some of it expected. We have our classic heroes in Drs. Zasloff, Kaplan, and Shore, whose perseverance in the face of hardship and caring for patients abandoned by the inequities of medicine are an inspiration to all aspiring scientists. We have a lesson repeated in the halls of research. Just two decades before research on FOP started, the cause of familial hypercholestrolemia (elevated cholesterol for non-scientists) was just as hidden as FOP. In order to pinpoint what exactly was malfunctioning biologically, two researchers focused their attention on a family with cholesterol levels in the thousands, way higher than even the danger level for humans. Instead of investigating mild forms of the disease, which often veils the biological problem, Drs. Michael Stuart Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein chose to tackle the most serious form of high cholesterol known to man. It is often said that the true nature of biology is revealed not in its center, but at its edges; for keeping close to this insight, Drs. Brown and Goldstein eventually discovered the Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and characterized its downstream pathway. For this and other contributions to the canon of cholesterol metabolism research, the duo was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. With their success, Drs. Brown and Goldstein accentuated the importance of research on rare diseases, of which FOP certainly is.

This diary is not meant to be overtly political, but as a current graduate student in cell and molecular biology, I cannot broach this subject without emphasizing the political circuitry that can quickly shut the door on future research. Any time conservatives gain power in government, an assault on science is sure to follow. Conservatives might fool the average person when they talk favorably about research and technology, but their rhetoric fools no scientist. As expected, the current Republican-controlled House of Representatives has placed science funding on the chopping block. Proposed cuts to NASA, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Science Foundation total over $$1.5 billion just for this year alone. When fewer dollars get pumped into research, fewer labs get funded (or labs receive less funding), which means fewer graduate students and post-docs - all eventually spiraling down to fewer cures and treatments for diseases.

For any aspiring scientist, this death spiral means more competition for positions and more stress as a researcher. As you can imagine, this is not a recipe for success in the lab.

For me specifically, it means that hundreds of FOP patients will spend another day waiting for a treatment to stop the progression of their painful second skeleton. You see, the reason I told you the story above is because I am currently a graduate student at the Center for FOP Research. I have met a teenage boy with FOP, and I can tell you it is the most disabling disease I have ever encountered. But beyond the contorted spine, fused neck, and entrapped arms is hope; if that boy can argue with his parents and text on his cellphone like any other teenager - a semblance of normalcy in the most abnormal world imaginable - then perhaps we can show the world that knowledge is power, and through science comes knowledge.

A great deal of gratitude is owed to Harry Eastlack, from whose skeleton our lab has gathered an innumerable amount of insight into FOP. It is only fitting that Mr. Eastlack's final resting place is in his hometown of Philadelphia. For him, the old adage ""you're never too far from home"" rings true. But his presence is also particularly strong for the FOP research community, as we are only a 20 minute walk away from seeing the man whose sacrifice helped lay the foundation for our work. Even to this day we sometimes get a little smarter about FOP by reexamining Mr. Eastlack's skeleton, looking for a replication of any new clinical observation we may encounter.

Perhaps the most comforting aspect of FOP is that even though patients are imprisoned in a panopticon of bone, their mind remains free. It gives us comfort than when we find a treatment for the disease - and believe me, we will find it - our patients will be able to enjoy it with the utmost salience. The tales of this brave Stone Man construct a story about despair and hope, ignorance and knowledge, and they will forever be a part of me.

The concept that organisms possess some factor that can be passed on from one organism to another, termed a ""transforming principle"", was developed from the work of bacteriologist Frederick Griffith. In 1928, Griffith discovered that injecting into mice a combination of a dead virulent strain of bacteria with an alive benign strain killed his animals. Since the virulent strain of bacteria was dead at the time of injection, some compound from it must have been transmitted to the alive bacteria, transforming it into a virulent strain, thus leading to his animals' death. The identity of this transforming principle would be revealed as DNA in 1944 by a trio of scientists. And finally, in 1953 scientists James Watson and Francis Crick would publish (warning - PDF) the structure of this hereditary molecule. For their discovery, the duo, along with Maurice Wilkins, would receive the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

A wave of research followed these forefathers of modern genetics. The central dogma of biology - DNA --> RNA --> proteins - was developed soon after the structure of DNA was published. Scientists were able fill in the molecular blanks missing from the works of pioneers such as Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel. It started to become clear that it was our DNA sequence that made us us. Efforts to sequence a genome of a biological entity first proved successful in 1977 following the completion of the Bacteriophage virus φX174 genome. The methods underlying the rudimentary sequencing technology used were vastly primitive compared to the advanced machines of modern times, which made the final result that much more remarkable. Soon, the genomic sequencing of common model organisms including Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a type of budding yeast) were initiated. As advances were made in characterizing numerous features of these model organisms, including their development, homeostasis mechanisms, and evolution, it became clear that in order for scientists to take the next step in their research, the human genome must be sequenced entirely.

A $$3-billion dollar joint venture between the United States Department of Energy and United States National Institutes of Health to sequence the human genome formally started 1990. The Human Genome Project consisted of a massive consortium of scientists across the globe, yet even with hundreds of researchers working on the project it was expected to take 15 years to complete. Progress was slow for the first several years, as the technology failed to meet the intense demands of the project.

The rate of progress finally started to increase in 1998 when the publicly-funded venture gained some fierce competition from the private sector. J. Craig Venter, a cavalier scientist and entrepreneur with a harsh reputation and strong ego, was unsatisfied with the NIH's progress. Not only did he believe he had a new method of sequencing (called ""Shotgun Sequencing"") that was better and faster than the pairwise end sequencing method used by the NIH, he believed that he could complete the human genome sequence for a fraction of $$3-billion cost. The scientists at the NIH had reason to take Dr. Venter seriously; researchers working for his start-up Celera Corporation were fast on the trails of the university researchers. This troubled the leading researchers at the Human Genome Project for two reasons. First, all scientists have a little bit of an ego, and if history were to repeat itself, the team that finished first would get all the credit. Second, and much more concerning to scientists, was the plan of Celera Corporation to patent the entire human genome, which could have devastating effects for biomedical research. This controversy has extended beyond Celera Corporation, and I will touch more on it below.

As the year 2000 dawned, it became clear that the sequencing of the human genome would be finished well before 2005, the initial projected date of completion. A potential clash between bio-research and bio-enterprise was avoided when in March 2000 President Clinton announced that the human genome could not be patented and should be shared freely among the research community. In an unexpected turn of events, Dr. Venter and his team at Celera accepted this announcement (though surely with disappointment) and backed off of plans to patent any portion of their revealed sequence. In early 2001, 11 long years after the initiation of the Human Genome Project, both the NIH and Celera Corporation published their respective sequences in the high-impact journals Nature and Science.

The impact of the completed human genome was enormous, and within the copious amount of data were some very surprising results. First, it was assumed that due to our extreme complexity and advancement over fellow mammals, humans had many more genes (sequences of DNA that code for proteins, the essential molecular building blocks of cells, tissues, and organs) than lesser animals. Some estimates even went as high as 100,000 genes. Therefore, it was extremely surprising to learn that this...

...has the same number of genes as this.

What became evident after the completion of the human genome was that our ability to construct different gene products through mechanisms such as alternative splicing is enhanced compared to lesser animals.

Another surprising result was that out of our 3 billion base pairs of DNA, only about 1.5% codes for proteins. At the time the genome sequence was completed, this other 98.5% was referred to as ""junk DNA"", but one of the advances since 2001 has been the discovery that non-coding DNA can have a profound impact on coding DNA. Nevertheless, when you read reports that we're 97-98% similar to orangutans or other hominids yet are confused why we look a good bit different, now you will know why - the differences in DNA sequence are heavily weighted in the DNA that actually codes for proteins.

All of the above findings are fascinating, but what did they eventually mean for the fields of research and medicine? The advancements in the research community as a result of the completed human genome were vast. With the completed human genome at hand (along with the completed genomes of other model organisms), researchers could now delve into the field of molecular evolution. Finally, biologists would have the data necessary to track the evolution of protein sequences, with a concept that protein domains or even specific amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) that were conserved throughout multiple species must be critical for a life process. This foundation has held true throughout biology, as researchers have found that mutating a highly conserved amino acid often leads to non-functional protein. The completion of the human (and mouse genome) has allowed researchers to develop transgenic mouse models for which to study the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. The revelation that mice and humans contain almost the exact same number of genes has further validated the use of mouse models in studying human disease.

However, while the impact on research science has been profound, the promise of a genomics revolution for medicine has yet to emerge. Largely, the completion of the human genome has enlightened scientists and physicians, though therapeutic methods as a result of this enhanced knowledge have been predominantly absent. Having the entire human DNA sequence at hand has allowed physicians to map out specific mutations for cancers. This information, in combination with previous knowledge about the overall pathways that a specific mutated gene reside in, have aided scientists to accurately predict which medicines will work for patients, and perhaps more importantly, which ones won't. Overall, this enables recommendations for medicines that affect biology at the pathway level, which more often than not aids in patient treatment and helps bring down the costs associated with prescriptions of ineffective medicines.

However, what hasn't come to fruition is the notion of ""personalized medicine"", the idea that individual treatment plans can be compiled based on an individual's DNA sequence. The problem is two fold. The first - being able to completely sequence an individual's DNA content - is getting closer and closer to being resolved. An effort that took over a decade and cost a total of over $$3-billion can now be finished in a matter of weeks and for far cheaper. This is still not good enough for clinical use, but scientists have predicted that within another decade, the field of genomics will be essentially ""dead"", as it will be feasible, quick, and cost-effective to sequence everyone's full DNA code.

Gleevec, an anti-cancer drug developed in the late 1990s, is one rare example of a medicine targeting specific cancer-causing mutations in patients.

Problem number two, which involves the development of personal pharmaceuticals, is a lot more troublesome. As a quick piece of background, the way a lot of medicines work is that they specifically bind proteins and prevent them from performing their normal function. When a protein is mutated, this binding pocket is often perturbed. Since the same type of cancer can be caused by literally hundreds of different mutations within a large gene, the amount of different protein conformations is very high. Thus, in order to ensure a perfect fit, a different molecule will have to developed for every single gene mutation. Some will have cross-reactivity, but the effectiveness will vary from patient to patient. It already costs billions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies to develop medicines that will benefit thousands, if not millions of patients. Ironically, the same completed genome that allows for cost reduction among broad medicines leads to astronomical costs for personalized medicines. While gene therapy and gene replacement remains in its very early stages (not to mention its bio-ethical implications), it likely is where the field of personalized medicine is going.

Lastly, the completion of the human genome and ability for us to easily sequence bits of or entire individual genes has far-reaching implications in regard to health insurance and DNA ""ownership"". With our exponentially increasing public research database, scientists and physicians are now able to look into our genetic future. Common mutations are now known for diseases including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Sickle Cell Anemia, and Cystic Fibrosis, just to name a few, and we have the ability determine whether an individual is affected. For many of the aforementioned diseases, their symptoms don't manifest well into adulthood. This raises a major bio-ethical question regarding knowledge of future (and in most cases, certain) disease. How would I feel if I knew it was certain I would get Alzheimer's disease in my elder years? If it's determined I have Cystic Fibrosis, should I have children knowing that the chances they will have the disease are vastly increased? These difficult but important decisions are reasons why physicians have been hesitant to embrace the field of personalized medicine.

Unfortunately, many people just don't know enough about genetics to fully understand the impact of knowing what our genes say. As we have seen throughout history, fear of the unknown is a powerful emotion, and some experts are anxious that many people won't be able to emotionally handle potentially devastating genetic news. This concern is even more prominent now that commercial DNA sequencing services exist, such as 23andMe. I myself have used the 23andMe service for both curiosity sake and family importance (of which I will write about here at DailyKos soon), but with my background in molecular biology, I am able to comprehend the implications of what my results said.

As I mentioned above, the reasoning behind the private investment to sequence the human genome stems from the ability to patent all sequenced genes. Thankfully, President Clinton listened to scientific community and declared the patenting of the entire human genome unallowable. However, the patenting of specific genes was not unheard of, even while the Human Genome Project was moving along. In the 1990s, a collaboration between a biotech company called Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah produced key research on the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are commonly associated with breast cancer. In order to capitalize financially on their findings, Myriad Genetics filed for patents on the sequences of both genes. These patents were granted in 1997 and 1998. Since breast cancer is a very common disease affecting millions, the number of labs studying BRCA1 and BRCA2 would be in the hundreds, if not thousands. For over a decade, every year a lab conducted research on either of these two genes, it would have to pay Myriad Genetics a royalty fee. Perhaps more concerning, if a woman wanted to know her risks for breast cancer related to her BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene sequences, she would have to pay $$3,000 for the genetic test. In 2009 a trademark complaint was made against Myriad Genetics, and a court nullified all of Myriad's patents. In an elegant defense of the laws of nature, the ruling judge wrote the following:

""The information encoded in DNA is not information about its own molecular structure incidental to its biological function, as is the case with adrenaline or other chemicals found in the body...this informational quality (of DNA) is unique among the chemical compounds found in our bodies, and it would be erroneous to view DNA as 'no different' than other chemicals previously the subject of patents....DNA, in particular the ordering of its nucleotides, therefore serves as the physical embodiment of laws of nature - those that define the construction of the human body…the preservation of this defining characteristic of DNA in its native and isolated forms mandates the conclusion that the challenged composition claims are to unpatentable products of nature.""

The case is still in litigation, as Myriad Genetics has filed an appeal. The final ruling will have far-reaching implications into the scope and economics of research and medical care.

Overall, the impact of the Human Genome Project has been immense. As a graduate student in cell and molecular biology, the availability of the entire human genome has empowered my lab's research and that of countless labs across the world. The field of molecular evolution has vindicated the prior work of anthropologists and evolutionary biologists that relied solely on fossil records and observable trait analysis. Research on genetic diseases has become much more focused, as geneticists now have a database to link identified mutations to specific genes. The emergence of commercial sequencing services has bridged the gap between research and medicine, with a little bit of fun mixed in as well. And while the progress toward personalized medicine has been slower than initially expected, the field is definitely moving in that direction. Because of this transition, it is paramount that proper and accurate science education remains at the forefront of any school curriculum. Hopefully you all have learned a great deal by reading this diary and will be able to add your educated opinion into the ring in regard to the future of personalized medicine and what it means for our overall care.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Sequenced: The Human Genome,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,
8011,3275606,dailykos.com,political,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2011/09/12/1016283/-This-Is-My-Secret-This-Is-His-Story,"The story of the Falling Man is a story worth telling. It is a story captured in the bounds of only ten seconds the morning of September 11, 2001. But it is also a story unbounded in its impact.

The above picture, a capture of strength, calmness, and order, belies the truth behind the Falling Man's descent toward the ground. It is but one photograph among a sequence, the rest depicting the chaos of a flailing plunge toward Earth.

The Falling Man elicits the entire spectrum of emotions associated with September 11th - sadness, horror, and fear; courage, strength, and bravery. That a family would shun that man as one of their own over a fear about the circumstance of his death suggests that the words inscribed in black marker on that image invoke feelings that are not exclusive to myself.

Tom Junod's Esquire piece that I linked to above elegantly completes the story of the man captured in that iconic image. The search for the Falling Man's identity was long and arduous, but it was believed to be finished after Mr. Junod came into contact with the family of Norberto Hernandez, a pastry chef at the Windows on the World restaurant that sat atop the North Tower.

In the aftermath of 9/11, the Hernandez family fractured apart, primarily over a dispute regarding the identity the Falling Man. Norberto's daughter Catherine offered a glimpse into why the family refused to believe Falling Man was their blood.

She asks for copies of the pictures so that she can show them to the people who believed that Norberto jumped out a window, while Catherine sits on the step with her palm spread over her heart. ""They said my father was going to hell because he jumped,"" she says. ""On the Internet. They said my father was taken to hell with the devil. ... Her mother is standing at the front door, about to go back inside her house. Her face has already lost its belligerent pride and has turned once again into a mask of composed, almost wistful sadness. ""Please,"" she says as she closes the door in a stain of morning sunlight. ""Please clear my husband's name.""



The story of Norberto Hernandez eventually became the story of Jonathan Briley. The Hernandez family got their wish, as after further investigation it was discovered that the Falling Man was not Norberto, but instead a different Windows on the World worker.

Of all the September 11th families desperate for any physical item from their fallen loved one, to me it is quite striking that family would rejoice so much that perhaps the most emotional and provocative image from that day did not capture their family member. The image would certainly be painful for the family of the Falling Man, but perhaps even a final image is better than emptiness.







* * *

Though the photograph above was captured on September 11, 2001, its underlying story extends beyond that single day. It is a story that brings together spirituality and secularism into the same room and makes them debate it out.

This is why I wrote what I wrote:

I have heard before from certain groups of Christians who consider suicide a sin that results in that person's soul being sent to hell. The argument behind this belief is as follows - because the afterlife with God is divine and eternally restful, there must be a barrier in place to prevent people from ending their lives prematurely to rush their ascent toward heaven. An additional argument is that because ""thou shall not kill"" is one of the Ten Commandments, a person who commits suicide is committing a sin and cannot repent because he or she is dead.

Though, as many of the commenters pointed out on Reddit.com and the PostSecret Community, anyone who fell from the Twin Towers on 9/11 did not enter the building knowing they were going to jump. They were forced not into a choice of not whether they would die, but how they would. They took that decision into their own hands. Therefore, medical examiners ruled those who jumped as homicides attributed to the terrorists.

My words are a criticism of religious (and particularly, Christian) absolutism. Even though many claim the Falling Man had no true choice, he did indeed. Choice for one of several methods of death, while extremely distressing and saddening, is choice nonetheless. And the choice of the Falling Man, when interpreted through the lense of a Christian absolutist, is that of suicide. And in that same lense, that of a one way ticket to hell.

Ironically, we hear constantly from these same Christian absolutists that their God is a benevolent one. Except if you are gay. Or if you resist complete authority. Or perhaps if you take your own life, like the Falling Man did, even if that choice is one of many that results in the same end - your death.

I reject that myopic mindset. But I believe the story of the Falling Man and who was thought to be his family lets us know that many don't.

The most interesting part about this secret and the wave of debate and commentary it sparked across the Internet is the large number of comments who thought that the secret sender (being me) is religious, which I can say unequivocally is far from the truth. Many other comments were flabbergasted that I wrote that the Falling Man ""killed himself"", implying that he intended to that morning before the chaos started. I still stand by my assertion that he indeed had a choice (in the true definition of the word, that of having options). But with my words I reject the notion of an evil, hateful God that would send a man to hell for escaping the hell on earth that was the North Tower on September 11th. And if God (if there really is one) would know why the Falling Man jumped, then he should certainly know that gay people can love each other as much as straight people, and that those who end their lives under the grasp of depression were not well and do not deserve whatsoever to be banished to the underworld.

That is why I wrote what I wrote.

Lastly, I sent the above secret to PostSecret on Monday (September 5th) of last week. But that is not the only secret I revealed that week. Only two days later on Wednesday night I revealed another secret that freed my heart and mind, only this one I did not submit online. To the person who heard that secret (you know who you are), I want to thank you for your grace and comfort with your response. The hour we spent talking after healed my mind and my heart, and I'm so grateful that we are even stronger friends than before.

As the FBI's terrorism report summed it up:



On April 4, 2003, the FBI arrested David Roland Hinkson, a constitutionalist and tax protestor, for attempting to arrange the murders of a federal judge, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and an IRS Agent whom he blamed for his legal problems regarding a tax evasion case against him. Between December 2002 and March 2003, Hinkson offered two individuals $$10,000 for committing all three murders. On January 27, 2005, Hinkson was found guilty on three counts of solicitation to commit murder after a three week jury trial in Boise, Idaho. On June 3, 2005, Hinkson was sentenced to 43 years in federal prison.

The tax case against Hinkson stemmed from his failure to pay almost a million dollars in income taxes between 1997 and 2000 and for refusing to file tax returns or to withhold income tax from the salaries of employees working for his multi-million dollar business, Water Oz, which sold dietary supplements. Hinkson often paid his employees in silver dollars (some anti-government extremists considered paper money illegal and unconstitutional). An IRS investigation, which began in the summer of 2000, ended in a raid on Hinkson's house and his arrest in 2002. Referring to the raid, Hinkson later wrote that ""I believe that...[government officials] orchestrated the raid on Water Oz and my home for the sole purpose of murdering me and ending the lawsuit that was filed against them by me."" Hinkson did sue the two officials, and several others, but the suit was dismissed--by Judge Lodge.

On May 6, 2004, several extremist members of the Project 7 Militia were arrested following an extensive investigation into the group by FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and local police. Investigation had identified leader David Burgert and five other members of the Project 7 Militia as having committed various violations of federal law in furtherance of violent plans targeting law enforcement officers and other government officials. Burgert, along with Tracy Brockway, James Day, John Slater, and Steven Morey, pled guilty to various federal weapons charges, including possession of machine guns and other illegal weapons as well as conspiracy to possess illegal weapons. On November 12, 2004, Burgert received an 87 month prison sentence for his role in the plotting. In early 2005, the four other members who entered guilty pleas received sentences ranging from 18 to 37 months in federal prison. A sixth subject, Larry Chezem, was convicted in a federal trial of conspiracy and was sentenced on September 30, 2005, to 15 months in prison.

The couple, however, insists that there is no law that requires citizens to pay income tax. ""There is no law. We looked and looked,"" Brown told the press. Brown and his supporters, including Randy Weaver, leader of the 1992 standoff with ATF agents at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, told the press that the government has unlawfully tricked people into believing they have to pay income tax, knowing full well that such a law would be unconstitutional. ""We will defend it to the death. This is 1776 all over again. You cannot tax someone's labor because that is slavery,"" Brown said.

At trial, the couple was found guilty of numerous charges including plotting to kill federal agents during the 2007 standoff; conspiring to prevent federal officers from performing their duties; conspiring to assault, resist or impede federal officers; using or carrying a firearm or destructive device during a violent crime; possessing a firearm or destructive device, being a felon in possession of a firearm; obstruction of justice; failing to appear at sentencing. Mr. Brown was also charged with failing to appear at trial. Edward Brown was sentence to 37 years, and Elaine Brown, 35 years.

As the ADL reported in 2005 , Hinkson then—like Bundy now—refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the federal claims against him, claims upheld by U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge:As it turns out, President Bush's FBI didn't take too kindly to men like the militia member at Bundy Ranch who was ""overheard boasting that he had two agent[s] in his gun sight and could 'take them down.'"" A year after Hinkson's arrest, federal officers apprehended members of the Project 7 Militia based in Flathead County, Montana:In a 2007 New Hampshire episode not covered by the FBI report above, another million-dollar tax cheater turned terrorist when Uncle Sam came for his money. That June, Ed Brown and his wife Elaine , already sentenced to 63 months in absentia for failing to pay his $$1 million tab, vowed ""that he and his wife would fight U.S. marshals to the death if they tried to capture them."" As ABC News reported at the time, the Browns had support from many of the usual suspects:Ultimately, Ed and his dentist wife ended up in prison for a lot longer than five years after they hunkered down in their 100-acre compound stocked with weapons Now, Cliven Bundy, backed by his well-armed well-wishers, claims he ""a citizen of Nevada and not a citizen of the territory of the United States."" Of course, he is a United States citizen, one who owes the government of his 317 million fellow citizens a million dollars for the privilege of receiving what it is, after all, food stamps for cows . At best, that makes Bundy a deadbeat. And by threatening federal officials just trying to collect the long overdue payment on the money he owes, Bundy and his Bundy Ranch gunmen make themselves domestic terrorists.

At least according to President Bush's FBI.

UPDATE: For more context on this discussion, it’s worth bearing in mind that the FBI’s definition of terrorism, whether foreign or domestic, has been essentially unchanged going back to the Clinton administration. In addition, the bureau distinguishes between terrorist incidents that actually occurred (Oklahoma City bombing) versus those prevented (Hinkson, Project 7 militia). (On a side note, the same FBI report mentioned in the diary classifies abortion clinic bombers and their conspirators as “terrorists,” something vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin among others rejected.) The larger point, for the likes of Fox News and its adherents, is that the classification of the Bundy Ranch crowd as “domestic terrorists” has been a bipartisan one.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Bush administration labeled Bundy Ranch-style outlaws domestic terrorists,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

Radioactivity has also been found in milk from Spokane, Washington.

Safe Levels of Radiation?

The government says there is no danger, as these levels (even levels in rainwater above drinking water standards) are “safe”. Specifically, they explain that the exposure is only short-term, while federal drinking water standards assume a constant level of radiation over the course of a year.

In addition, not all of the radiation from the rainwater will end up in the drinking water supply. So – say federal and state governments – there is no danger from short-term exposure to such levels of radiation.

But as I pointed out recently:

Physicians for Social Responsibility notes: According to the National Academy of Sciences, there are no safe doses of radiation. Decades of research show clearly that any dose of radiation increases an individual’s risk for the development of cancer. “There is no safe level of radionuclide exposure, whether from food, water or other sources. Period,” said Jeff Patterson, DO, immediate past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility. “Exposure to radionuclides, such as iodine-131 and cesium-137, increases the incidence of cancer. For this reason, every effort must be taken to minimize the radionuclide content in food and water.” “Consuming food containing radionuclides is particularly dangerous. If an individual ingests or inhales a radioactive particle, it continues to irradiate the body as long as it remains radioactive and stays in the body,”said Alan H. Lockwood, MD, a member of the Board of Physicians for Social Responsibility. *** Radiation can be concentrated many times in the food chain and any consumption adds to the cumulative risk of cancer and other diseases. John LaForge notes:

The National Council on Radiation Protection says, “… every increment of radiation exposure produces an incremen­tal increase in the risk of cancer.” The Environmental Protection Agency says, “… any exposure to radiation poses some risk, i.e. there is no level below which we can say an exposure poses no risk.” The Department of Energy says about “low levels of radiation” that “… the major effect is a very slight increase in cancer risk.” The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says, “any amount of radiation may pose some risk for causing cancer … any increase in dose, no matter how small, results in an incremental increase in risk.” The National Academy of Sciences, in its “Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII,” says, “… it is unlikely that a threshold exists for the induction of cancers ….” Long story short, “One can no longer speak of a ‘safe’ dose level,” as Dr. Ian Fairlie and Dr. Marvin Resnikoff said in their report “No dose too low,” in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. And Brian Moench, MD, writes:

Administration spokespeople continuously claim “no threat” from the radiation reaching the US from Japan, just as they did with oil hemorrhaging into the Gulf. Perhaps we should all whistle “Don’t worry, be happy” in unison. A thorough review of the science, however, begs a second opinion. That the radiation is being released 5,000 miles away isn’t as comforting as it seems…. Every day, the jet stream carries pollution from Asian smoke stacks and dust from the Gobi Desert to our West Coast, contributing 10 to 60 percent of the total pollution breathed by Californians, depending on the time of year. Mercury is probably the second most toxic substance known after plutonium. Half the mercury in the atmosphere over the entire US originates in China. It, too, is 5,000 miles away. A week after a nuclear weapons test in China, iodine 131 could be detected in the thyroid glands of deer in Colorado, although it could not be detected in the air or in nearby vegetation. The idea that a threshold exists or there is a safe level of radiation for human exposure began unraveling in the 1950s when research showed one pelvic x-ray in a pregnant woman could double the rate of childhood leukemia in an exposed baby. Furthermore, the risk was ten times higher if it occurred in the first three months of pregnancy than near the end. This became the stepping-stone to the understanding that the timing of exposure was even more critical than the dose. The earlier in embryonic development it occurred, the greater the risk. A new medical concept has emerged, increasingly supported by the latest research, called “fetal origins of disease,” that centers on the evidence that a multitude of chronic diseases, including cancer, often have their origins in the first few weeks after conception by environmental insults disturbing normal embryonic development. It is now established medical advice that pregnant women should avoid any exposure to x-rays, medicines or chemicals when not absolutely necessary, no matter how small the dose, especially in the first three months.

“Epigenetics” is a term integral to fetal origins of disease, referring to chemical attachments to genes that turn them on or off inappropriately and have impacts functionally similar to broken genetic bonds. Epigenetic changes can be caused by unimaginably small doses – parts per trillion – be it chemicals, air pollution, cigarette smoke or radiation. Furthermore, these epigenetic changes can occur within minutes after exposure and may be passed on to subsequent generations. The Endocrine Society, 14,000 researchers and medical specialists in more than 100 countries, warned that “even infinitesimally low levels of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, indeed, any level of exposure at all, may cause endocrine or reproductive abnormalities, particularly if exposure occurs during a critical developmental window. Surprisingly, low doses may even exert more potent effects than higher doses.” If hormone-mimicking chemicals at any level are not safe for a fetus, then the concept is likely to be equally true of the even more intensely toxic radioactive elements drifting over from Japan, some of which may also act as endocrine disruptors. Many epidemiologic studies show that extremely low doses of radiation increase the incidence of childhood cancers, low birth-weight babies, premature births, infant mortality, birth defects and even diminished intelligence. Just two abdominal x-rays delivered to a male can slightly increase the chance of his future children developing leukemia. By damaging proteins anywhere in a living cell, radiation can accelerate the aging process and diminish the function of any organ. Cells can repair themselves, but the rapidly growing cells in a fetus may divide before repair can occur, negating the body’s defense mechanism and replicating the damage. Comforting statements about the safety of low radiation are not even accurate for adults. Small increases in risk per individual have immense consequences in the aggregate. When low risk is accepted for billions of people, there will still be millions of victims. New research on risks of x-rays illustrate the point. Radiation from CT coronary scans is considered low, but, statistically, it causes cancer in one of every 270 40-year-old women who receive the scan. Twenty year olds will have double that rate. Annually, 29,000 cancers are caused by the 70 million CT scans done in the US. Common, low-dose dental x-rays more than double the rate of thyroid cancer. Those exposed to repeated dental x-rays have an even higher risk of thyroid cancer. *** Beginning with Madam Curie, the story of nuclear power is one where key players have consistently miscalculated or misrepresented the risks of radiation. The victims include many of those who worked on the original Manhattan Project, the 200,000 soldiers who were assigned to eye witness our nuclear tests, the residents of the Western US who absorbed the lion’s share of fallout from our nuclear testing in Nevada, the thousands of forgotten victims of Three Mile Island or the likely hundreds of thousands of casualties of Chernobyl. This could be the latest chapter in that long and tragic story when, once again, we were told not to worry.

Internal Emitters

Proponents of nuclear energy and nuclear weapons argue that we can’t eliminate all man-made radioactivity, that nuclear power and weapons are good, and that we need standards to promote a logical cost-benefit analysis.

But as I noted last week, the current standards are misleading:

There are, of course, naturally occurring radioactive materials. But lumping all types of radiation together is misleading … and is comparing apples to oranges. As the National Research Council’s Committee to Assess the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program explains: Radioactivity generates radiation by emitting particles. Radioactive materials outside the the body are called external emitters, and radioactive materials located within the body are called internal emitters. Internal emitters are much more dangerous than external emitters. Specifically, one is only exposed to radiation as long as he or she is near the external emitter. For example, when you get an x-ray, an external emitter is turned on for an instant, and then switched back off. But internal emitters steadily and continuously emit radiation for as long as the particle remains radioactive, or until the person dies – whichever occurs first. As such, they are much more dangerous. Dr. Helen Caldicott and many other medical doctors and scientists have confirmed this. See this and this.

*** It is important to note that each individual internal emitters behaves differently. They each accumulate in different places in the body, target different organs, mimic different vitamins and minerals, and are excreted differently (or not at all). Therefore, comparing radioactive cesium or iodine with naturally occurring radioactive substances – even those which can become internal emitters – is incorrect and misleading.

As radiation expert Dr. Chris Busby notes:



The radiation risk model of the European Committee on Radiation Risk is described in ECRR2010. It differs from the model currently employed by radiation protection agencies which are based on the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection ICRP. The latter (ICRP) model deals with radiation exposure from all sources in the same way, as if it were external to the body, and generally averages the dose to the body as if it were uniform across tissues more massive than 1 kilogram. The ICRP model then takes this dose and multiplies it by a risk factor for cancer linearly based on the cancer yield at high acute doses of the Japanese survivor populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who have been studied since 1952. This method cannot apply to internal doses from radioactive substances,called radionuclides, which have been inhaled or ingested in food or water. This is because these substances have varying affinities for DNA and different parts of the body and can deliver very high energy to local tissue. The ICRP method cannot either be applied to inhaled or ingested hot particles, which are solid but microscopic and can lodge in tissue delivering high doses to local cells. There is a great deal of evidence that exposure to internal radionuclides is up to 1000 times more harmful than the ICRP model concludes.

Busby also recently noted:



Since the Fukushima accident we have seen a stream of experts on radiation telling us not to worry, that the doses are too low, that the accident is nothing like Chernobyl and so forth. They appear on television and we read their articles in the newspapers and online. Fortunately the majority of the public don’t believe them. *** Patients receiving a course of radiotherapy usually get a dose of more than 20,000 mSv to vital healthy tissue close to the treated tumour. This tissue survives only because the treatment is spread over many days giving healthy cells time for repair or replacement. A sea-change is needed in our attitude to radiation, starting with education and public information. *** External irradiation is not the problem. The problem is internal irradiation. The Iodine-131 is not in the whole body, it is in the thyroid gland and attached to the blood cells: hence the thyroid cancer and the leukaemia. And there is a whole list of internal radioactive elements that bind chemically to DNA, from Strontium-90 to Uranium. These give massive local doses to the DNA and to the tissues where they end up. The human body is not a piece of wire that you can apply physics to. The concept of dose which [Pollyannas use] cannot be used for internal exposures. This has been conceded by the ICRP itself in its publications. And in an interview with me in Stockholm in 2009, Dr Jack Valentin, the ex-Scientific Secretary of the ICRP conceded this, and also made the statement that the ICRP risk model, the one used by all governments to assess the outcome of accidents like Fukushima, was unsafe and could not be used. You can see this interview on the internet, on www.vimeo.com. Why is the ICRP model unsafe? Because it is based on “absorbed dose”. This is average radiation energy in Joules divided by the mass of living tissue into which it is diluted. A milliSievert is one milliJoule of energy diluted into one kilogram of tissue. As such it would not distinguish between warming yourself in front of a fire and eating a red hot coal. It is the local distribution of energy that is the problem. The dose from a singly internal alpha particle track to a single cell is 500mSv! The dose to the whole body from the same alpha track is 5 x 10-11 mSv. That is 0.000000000005mSv. But it is the dose to the cell that causes the genetic damage and the ultimate cancer. The cancer yield per unit dose employed by ICRP is based entirely on external acute high dose radiation at Hiroshima, where the average dose to a cell was the same for all cells. *** The last thing [proponents of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy] wanted was the doctors and epidemiologists stopping their fun. The IAEA and the World Health Organisation (WHO) signed an agreement in 1959 to remove all research into the issue from the doctors of the WHO, to the atom scientists, the physicists of the IAEA: this agreement is still in force. The UN organisations do not refer to, or cite any scientific study, which shows their statements on Chernobyl to be false. There is a huge gap between the picture painted by the UN, the IAEA, the ICRP and the real world. And the real world is increasingly being studied and reports are being published in the scientific literature: but none of the authorities responsible for looking after the public take any notice of this evidence.

The Politics Behind the “Science”

I wrote to professor Busby and asked him if the faulty standards – based on external emitters – applied to radiation standards for drinking water, milk and food as well. Specifically, I asked:



Are the current “safe levels” of radioactivity set by governments for drinking water, milk and food based upon external emitters? Or upon internal emitters? I know that the Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters (CERRIE) [an independent Committee established by the UK Government in 2001, in which Dr. Busby participated] looked at this issue, but I can’t figure out whether governments ever changed their “safe” levels for food and beverages based on internal emitter science.

I mentioned the radioactive iodine found in rainwater in the U.S. and pointed out that the Canadian government is refusing to test milk for radiation – which is guaranteed to create internal emitters of any radiation when we drink it – based on the statement that radiation levels in the air are not all that high:

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csGHOVZ_vXk]

Dr. Busby responded:



The current risk model is based upon external acute radiation at high dose rate, the Japanese A-Bomb [i.e. from measurements of the effect of uniform, external radiation on the residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]. It is incorrect for internal and this was discussed at CERRIE but the implications were so alarming that the government sacked the Environment minister Michael Meacher who set up the committee and shut it down before it had finished (or even started) the research it was doing and also brought legal threats to bear on members so the final report is a whitewash, even though it concedes the problem exists and that the error may be as high at 10-fold. In fact, there is plenty of data and studies that show the error is from 500 to upwards of 1000. But this is not for all radionuclides, only some. The ECRR (www.euradcom.org) has studied this issue and provided risk model for internal emitters.

As the European Committee on Radiation Risk’s reports note:



The error in the [prevailing] ICRP model [i]s about 500 to 1000-fold.

Dr. Busby explained that the standards for radioiodine are about 20 times higher than they should be when it will be taken inside the body, and for certain radioactive particulates, up to 1,000 times higher than is safe.

Note: Even though current standards are way too high, the EPA is trying to raise the current standards much higher. Just as with the Gulf oil spill and other environmental (and economic) problems, governments are fudging the “science” (and suppressing basic information) to fit a political agenda.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"Radiation Experts: Radiation Standards Are Up to 1,000 Higher Than Is Safe for the Human Body","Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد, Karl Johanson, Andrea Jennetta",,[''],,,,

Antiwar argues:

The only reason the whole allegation [that the Syrian government used chemical weapons] hasn’t been dismissed out of hand is the administration’s repeated claims that they have better, secret intelligence that they’re just not showing anyone, or occasionally are letting already pro-war Congressmen get a glimpse of.

But – as the Weekly Standard reports – some Congressmen who have gotten a classified briefing aren’t impressed:

“I have just attended a classified Congressional briefing on Syria that quite frankly raised more questions than it answered. I found the evidence presented by Administration officials to be circumstantial” …. liberal Democrat Tom Harkin says in a statement released after today’s classified Capitol Hill briefing.

The Guardian reports:

As members of Congress emerged from the briefing, it was clear that the Obama administration could not be sure of the outcome of the president’s high-risk strategy. In particular, Obama could not count on his own party to deliver the votes. “I don’t know if every member of Congress is there yet,” said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat who said she would vote no on authorising a military strike. “The room was sceptical,” said Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat.

The U.S. government’s main “classified” claims is that it intercepted communications from the Syrian government both before and after the chemical weapons attack which implicate at least some people in Assad’s government. For example, the Washington Post notes:



Unknown to Syrian officials, U.S. spy agencies recorded each step in the alleged chemical attack, from the extensive preparations to the launching of rockets to the after-action assessments by Syrian officials. Those records and intercepts would become the core of the Obama administration’s evidentiary case linking the Syrian government to what one official called an “indiscriminate, inconceivable horror” — the use of outlawed toxins to kill nearly 1,500 civilians, including at least 426 children.

Who would have intercepted those communications?

The classic bubble scenario is being formed once again, as always on foot of disconnection between the real economic returns to the assets and asset valuations. This bubble will have to deflate.

""Productivity and Potential Output Before, During, and After the Great Recession"" a new paper by John Fernald (NBER Working Paper No. 20248, June 2014) looks at the U.S. labor and total-factor productivity growth slowdown prior to the Great Recession in the context of the slowdown ""located in industries that produce information technology (IT) or that use IT intensively, consistent with a return to normal productivity growth after nearly a decade of exceptional IT-fueled gains"". In a sense, the paper reinforces the point of view that I postulated in my TEDx talk last year dealing with the 'end' of the Age of Tech (here: http://trueeconomics.blogspot.ie/2013/11/14112013-human-capital-age-of-change.html ).Fernald opens the paper with a set of two quotes. One brilliantly describes the core question we face:""When we look back at the 1990s, from the perspective of say 2010,…[w]e may conceivably conclude…that, at the turn of the millennium, the American economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation….Alternatively, that 2010 retrospective might well conclude that a good deal of what we are currently experiencing was just one of the many euphoric speculative bubbles that have dotted human history."" Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (2000)Fernald argues that ""The past two decades have seen the rise and fall of exceptional U.S. productivity growth. This paper argues that labor and total-factor-productivity (TFP) growth slowed prior to the Great Recession. It marked a retreat from the exceptional, but temporary, information-technology (IT)-fueled pace from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. This retreat implies slower output growth going forward as well as a narrower output gap than recently estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO, 2014a).""Figure 1 from the paper illustrates how the mid-1990s surge in productivity growth indeed ended prior to the Great Recession. The rise in labor-productivity growth, shown by the height of the bars, came after several decades of slower growth. But, notes Fernald, ""in the decade ending in 2013:Q4, growth has returned close to its 1973-95 pace. The figure shows that the slower pace of growth in both labor productivity and TFP was similar in the four years prior to the onset of the Great Recession as in the six years since.""And things have been bad since. Labour productivity growth (slope of liner trend below) is now on par with what we have been witnessing in 1973-1995, and shallower than in 1995-2003. But the trend is still close to actual performance, which signals little potential for any appreciable acceleration:Beyond labour productivity, things are even messier. Charts below plot the Great Recession against other recessions in terms of productivity, output and labour utilisation:Notes: For each plot, quarter 0 is the NBER business-cycle peak which, for the Great Recession,corresponds to 2007:Q4. The shaded regions show the range of previous recessions since 1953. Localmeans are removed from all growth rates prior to cumulating, using a biweight kernel with bandwidth of 48 quarters. Source is Fernald (2014).All of the above show the cyclical disaster that is the current Great Recession, but crucially, they show poor recent performance in Labour Productivity, exceptionally poor performance in Hours of Labour used, disastrous performance in Total Factor Productivity… in other words - historically problematic trends relating to productivity, labour utilisation and tech-related productivity in the current recession compared to all previous recessions.But more worrying is that, as Fernald notes: ""That the slowdown predated the Great Recession rules out causal stories from the recession itself. …The evidence here complements Kahn and Rich’s (2013) finding in a regime-switching model that, by early 2005—i.e., well before the Great Recession—the probability reached nearly unity that the economy was in a low-growth regime.""So what's behind all of this slowing productivity growth? ""A natural hypothesis is that the slowdown was the flip side of the mid-1990s speedup. Considerable evidence… links the TFP speedup to the exceptional contribution of IT—computers, communications equipment, software, and the Internet. IT has had a broad-based and pervasive effect through its role as a general purpose technology (GPT) that fosters complementary innovations, such as business reorganization. Industry TFP data provide evidence in favor of the IT hypothesis versus alternatives. Notably, the euphoric, “bubble” sectors of housing, finance, and natural resources do not explain the slowdown. Rather, the slowdown is in the remaining ¾ of the economy, and is concentrated in industries that produce IT or that use IT intensively. IT users saw a sizeable bulge in TFP growth in the early 2000s, even as IT spending itself slowed. That pattern is consistent with the view that benefiting from IT takes substantial intangible organizational investments that, with a lag, raise measured productivity. By the mid-2000s, the low-hanging fruit of IT had been plucked.""This a hugely far-reaching paper with",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","exit, ECB, Ireland, Stimulus, structural depression, Tech, Age of Tech, structural crisis, structural recession, liquidity trap, Great Recession, human capital, Monetary policy, Austerity, TFP, QE exit, QE, Euro area, Labour productivity, structural trap, structural slowdown",,

Bloomberg article number 1.

Nov. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government is prepared to provide more than $$7.76 trillion on behalf of American taxpayers after guaranteeing $$306 billion of Citigroup Inc. debt yesterday. The pledges, amounting to half the value of everything produced in the nation last year, are intended to rescue the financial system after the credit markets seized up 15 months ago. The unprecedented pledge of funds includes $$3.18 trillion already tapped by financial institutions in the biggest response to an economic emergency since the New Deal of the 1930s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

SusanG blogged about this a few days ago as well...

Bloomberg article number 2

Nov. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve took two new steps to unfreeze credit for homebuyers, consumers and small businesses, committing up to $$800 billion. The central bank will purchase as much as $$600 billion of debt issued or backed by government-chartered housing-finance companies. It will also set up a $$200 billion program to support consumer and small-business loans, the Fed said in statements today in Washington.

Wow.

So I went to the US Census website and crunched some numbers. They have a nice excel spread sheet that you can download that lays out all sorts of juicy information.

So I went to their projected census results and the most up to date data is for July 2007.

I downloaded their excel sheet and found this:

- 18 to 64 years 189,831,466- 65 years and over 37,887,958

Total population 18 and over = 227,719,424

So if we take the pledge bailout money to date that would = 8,560,000,000,000 That's 8.56 trillion, and equally divide that by the census numbers for everyone 18 and older we get $$37590.12 for each and every person!

I am well aware that there are many gray areas as for the exact number, such as whether or not your in prison, possible expats, and you can start working at age 14. Even if you were to fudge the numbers for those, and I am sure other exceptions, I doubt it will push the number very far from this original quote.

What I find most stunning from these numbers is that if millions of family's were to get a check for about 70 grand a piece, the same families that owe the debt to these failing banks, they could meet their original debt obligations, and the banks would not be failing as they are now.

On top of that the MBS's market, and the CDS market which is tied to the MBS market, would instantly settle down because the fear of default by millions of Americans would instantly disappear. And then the 'credit' crisis would no longer exists, because large institutions would not fear whether or not a certain bank could repay a short overnight line of credit a few billion. (because the loans they are servicing have now become substantially healthier)

The TED Spread would fall, the A2-P2 spread would decrease, small, mid size, and large cap companies would once again be able to access capital at competitive rates and most importantly falling housing prices would subside because US citizens could make their mortgage payments.

In any event I am willing to bet that if the cash was put in the hand of the American consumer that it would have stimulated our economy, (and the global economy) in a much more effective and permanent fashion than this current boondoggle.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,$$37590.12 for Every US Citizen 18 and Over,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

8025,3275620,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,http://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/QE%20exit,"BIS Working Papers No 448 ""The exit from non-conventional monetary policy: what challenges?"" by Philip Turner published last week offers some interesting analysis of the risks we can expect in the process of the unwinding of the QE measures and other non-orthodox supports extended by the Central Banks following the GFC. The topic of huge importance for anyone interested in the forward analysis of the advanced economies and the one I have covered over the recent years under my thesis of the impossible monetary policy dilemma both on this blog and in my Sunday Times articles.Note: link to the paper http://www.bis.org/publ/work448.pdf ""One legacy of the monetary policies pursued since the financial crisis is that central banks in most advanced economies now have exceptionally large balance sheets. And commercial bank reserves (“money”) have risen by several multiples. These policies have made the exit challenge faced by central banks more complex. But there is no consensus on the New Normal for the balance sheet of central banks.This paper argues that the crisis has forced a critical examination of some widely-held beliefs about the division of labour between different agencies of government in implementing macroeconomic policies. The central bank has become more dependent on what the government decides – on fiscal policy, on government financing choices and on regulations requiring banks and other financial firms to hold government bonds. The exit will succeed only if central banks remain free of fiscal dominance and financial dominance.""But what does this really mean?The paper starts by positing three orthodoxies or dogmas that dominated the past thinking on monetary-fiscal policies interlinks and that have been proven to be wrong by the current crisis:""In recent years, The New Keynesian perspective incorporating rational expectations and perfect asset substitutability also had a number of convenient implications for policymakers. It shaped what has been called the pre-crisis “doctrine” of monetary policy, andtherefore was partly responsible for the severity of the recent crisis… [the] three “dogmas” that are of interest for the purpose of this paper:a) Open market operations in government bond markets (or in foreign exchange markets) do not change relative prices. … [in other words] any purchase or sale of particular assets would lead only to offsetting changes in private demands, with no impact on prices. One corollary of this is that government debt management (that is, the relative supply of short-dated and long-dated bonds by the Treasury) can be separated from monetary policy.b) The central bank short-term policy rate is the unique instrument of monetary policy aimed at macroeconomic objectives. The impact of policies on other core financial market prices – such as the term premium in the long-term interest rate – was neglected…c) The “liquidity” of the balance sheets of commercial banks is irrelevant. If adequate capital standards are in place to ensure the viability of a bank, there was no additional need for bank regulators to worry about the liquidity of banks because a sound bank could borrow readily in interbank markets to meet any “temporary” liquidity squeeze. Hence the failure of international regulators in the 1980s to develop common measures of the overall liquidity of a bank (and the decline in liquid asset ratios) seemed unimportant.""As Turner notes: ""…all three “dogmas” have been shown by recent events to be false.""In particular, ""Central bank balance sheets matter. Large-scale central bank purchases of bonds (and other assets) have lowered long-term interest rates, leading economists to re-examine the portfolio rebalancing affects that the New Classical school had dismissed. The neat separation between central bank open market operations and government debt management has been blurred. And banks now pay much closer attention to the liquidity of their balance sheets (with bank regulation in this area having been strongly reinforced since the crisis). Equally, the scale of balance sheet measures taken by central banks actually reinforces the fundamental logic behind the New Classical theories. An intertemporal perspective – a key insight of rational expectations – has become even more necessary. Because of the substantial lengthening in the maturity of central bank assets, the decisions taken during this crisis will have more long-lasting (and therefore more uncertain) effects than if policy action had been limited to short-term interest rates or short-dated paper.""How big is that 'long-lasting effects' bit?And more crucially, as we know the size of the problem, how difficult or painful will it be to undo this QE legacy?Consider one aspect of the legacy: the link between asset prices (financial markets valuations) and the interest rate risk (the cost of undoing the QE). Per Turner: ""Getting long-term rates down has contributed to bringing financial asset prices in the core economies back to pre-crisis levels, even higher. And, ...Gambacorta et al (2012) show that the expansion of central bank balance sheets didincrease real GDP. In this sense, QE policies have worked.""But just because it worked in the past, does this mean unwinding it will be cost-less even if 'handled right'?As Turner points, ""there is a reassuring answer. The massive purchases of central banks have had wealth effects that should, in time, stimulate global demand. In addition, stronger asset prices should raise the value of potential collateral for new loans and therefore ease the borrowing constraints facing firms and households. Once stronger aggregate demand is assured, the central bankcould readily unload the assets acquired during the crisis.""In other words, the idea of the 'well-managed exit' is that it will come at the time of demand boom and this demand boom should reduce adverse costs of the exits. In theory.""The problem with this reassuring answer is that the recent recession – now more than five years long – has lasted so long. Financial asset prices did get a considerable boost. Yet the hoped-for growth in real GDP that would have allowed central banks to scale back crisis-related asset purchases did not materialise.""The good times arrived, but not for the real economy. 'Well-managed' exits are not really on the books, since ""this disconnect between the rapid rise in asset prices and the persistent weakness of demand is worrying. Is this a bubble that could suddenly deflate? Or do forecasters underestimate the strength of real demand over the next couple of years?""And there is more: ""Another worry is that global net interest rate exposures must have risen substantially since the crisis. At the core of this is US Treasury debt outstanding held outside the Federal Reserve. This rose from $$3 trillion in early 2007 (yielding anaverage of 5%) to $$8 trillion (with an average yield of 1%) by mid-2013. The rise of government debt in other advanced economies – financed at yields that track US Treasuries – is well-known. Much of this risk is in the banking system: sovereign exposures accounted for 19% of total banking book exposures of large international banks in mid-2012, compared with 11% at end-2008. Lower-rated corporations have also benefited from the negative or zero term premium in government debt markets, so credit risks have probably risen too."" Turner does not mention households, but they too were allowed breathing room on funding their debts - as policy rates scaled back, cost of funding mortgages and other debts fell. But debt levels did not fall significantly enough, with exception of bankruptcies and foreclosures cases.""Furthermore, the link between US yields and yields on EM bonds has increased substantially over the past decade, and EM bond issuance has risen.""In plain English: we are all (governments/taxpayers, corporates, households and even emerging markets) are sitting on a ticking time bomb: once rates start rising, we start feeling the pain of higher debt funding costs. What miracle of 'well-managed exit' strategy can deliver us from this predicament?The latter is the rhetorical question. ""The scale of market turbulence in global bond markets from May to September 2013 demonstrates the importance, in any correction, of the outstanding stocks of assets. Quantities matter. The vastly increased volume of bonds outstanding, some held in leveraged portfolios, means that volatility will rise much more when market sentiment changes than it did in the past when outstanding stocks of bonds were much lower."" What's that I hear? More volatility than in previous crises? Surely this cannot be good.""The turbulence also illustrates the dominance of US Treasuries. A substantial rise in US long-term rates took place without any change in the policy rate in the United States."" In other words, the Fed did not pause priming the pump, but rates went up… oops… ""Such a strong and global market reaction suggests some sudden unwinding of leveraged positions and powerful contagion across markets.""Bingo! In the markets bubbly high on cheap liquidity, there is no 'well-managed exit' feasible.Turner is, of course, all BIS on this point. ""It is difficult to know what lies ahead.""Except this: rates will go up. ""Central banks in the advanced economies are not comfortable with the size and structure of their balance sheets. From September 2009, governors of the major central banks (including Messrs Bernanke and Trichet) expressed the hope that they would soon be able to begin their “exit” from unconventional policies. But such hopes were dashed by the deepening euro crisis from mid-2010. Not only have central bank balance sheets further expanded but – equally important – the maturity of their assets has become much longer.""And with this 'staying in QE', Central Banks are gaining a new risk / problem: ""Since their liabilities have remained of very short maturity (typically bank reserves), central banks have a growing maturity mismatch. A sizable term spread gives the central bank a positive running yield: this has boosted its profits typically remitted to the Treasury, often creating a favourable impression with parliaments."" (Do recall my recent article on Irish Central Bank annual report published in Sunday Times… Bingo!)""But higher short-term rates could at some point lead to central bank losses. This has no fundamental significance because the central bank does not face the financing constraint in its own currency that a private agent faces: it can print money."" Oops… not Irish Central Bank can't… and ECB does not like to…""Likewise, the government can raise taxes."" Oops again, Irish Government can barely run a deficit at less than double European SGP limits on already sky-high taxes. Raising taxes further would be committing political seppuku.So the conclusion is that ""There will be many years ahead when central banks will have government and other bonds on their balance sheets. The accumulation of such substantial holdings was warranted only by the crisis situation that confronted central banks. It is difficult to know at present what the new “normal” size of such holdings will be. How quickly central banks reduce their bond portfolio will depend on (unknown) macroeconomic or financial developments over the next several years.""That's it, folks, the drunk will have to be primed with whisky for years ahed, lest he wakes up with a horrific hangover. That's the 'solution' to the 'exit' dilemma.And this might not even solve the problem either. Here is why. Per Turner: ""Could central bank sales or purchases of government bonds become viewed as a second policy instrument once monetary policy begins be tightened? Policies of Quantitative Tightening could well moderate any increase in the policy rate."" In other words, can Central Banks hold off sales of government paper to allow higher liquidity in the system to offset interest rates increases?Not so fast: ""…one practical difficulty is that it is impossible to quantify how bond markets would react to central bank sales. Using estimates based on past experience of the policies that change the volume and maturity of government debt to be sold (such as those mentioned above) fail to take account of signalling effects. News of central bank selling even on a modest scale could send markets a signal that is more powerful than the actual sales (“They are testing the water for further, larger sales”). …The hyper-sensitivity of markets to guesses about future central bank sales was very well illustrated over the summer of 2013. The mention by Chairman Bernanke of what should have been obvious – that at some point the Fed would reduce the pace of its purchases – wreaked havoc in global bond markets … even with the very clear commitment of the Fed to keep short-term rates close to zero for a considerable time. The size and spread of this market adjustment suggest that many investors had highly leveraged positions.""What about the option of just allowing bonds to mature, thus preventing the need for sales? As Turner points out, this still will not be a neutral policy choice. ""It would mean central bank balance sheets remaining large beyond 2020. And it would also mean that the timing of shrinking – which would have effects on financial markets and the macroeconomy – would depend only on the pattern of past purchases and be quite independent of future economic conditions. It could even continue into the next recession."" Ah, the dreaded bit no one mentions at all, but the BIS grim reaper… the next recession. You know, while all Governments and Central Banks keep droning on about the next expansion, one has to remember the simply fact of nature: there will be another recession. And given the duration of the current anaemic recovery, it might arrive well before the economies have fully recovered from the previous shock.Where's me parachute?.. cause this saucer is increasing looking likely to crash.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","exit, US bonds, labour income, monetary policy dilemma, Impossible Monetary Dilemma, Bank of Japan, Public Debt, future skills, structural crisis, Asset Prices, Monetary policy, labour cost, Global growth, Interest rates, Euro area policy, QE, Japan Government Bonds, exits, ECB, structural depression, structural recession, Japan QE, Austerity, Impossible Monetary Policy Dilemma, QE and financial markets, human capital, Banks deleveraging, QE exit, Government debt, US Fed, Stimulus, tapering",,

We noted last month than Congress is less popular than North Korea, cockroaches, lice, root canals, colonoscopies, traffic jams, used car salesmen, Genghis Khan, Communism, BP during the Gulf oil spill, Nixon during Watergate or King George during the American Revolution.

The Washington Post notes today that a Syria intervention is less popular than Congress. So that means that the American people would much rather get a root canal or a colonoscopy than bomb Syria.

Indeed, while John Kerry announced today that the Syrian government used chemical weapons, Reuters noted:

8028,3275623,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/09/congressional-progressivepentagon-caucus.html,"Back in 2007, the Congressional Progressive Caucus helped organize 90 Congress members to commit to voting against war funding. Most of them turned around and voted for war funding. That was a high point for the CPC. Since then, its commitments — such as to vote against corporate healthcare — have hardly been taken seriously, and so it’s hardly been news when most members have gone back on their commitments.

The CPC has shifted in recent years away from pretending to take a stand on things, and instead toward issuing statements full of non-committal rhetoric. That, too, is now a stage in the devolution of the CPC to which we can look back with nostalgia.

The CPC, on the question of a new war on Syria, is choosing to do nothing at all. In fact, one of its two co-chairs is actively promoting war. Compare this whip list with this list of CPC members. You’ll notice that virtually no members of the House of Representatives have taken any position on whether or not to attack Syria. That includes most of those who claimed they wanted the president to allow a vote, as the Constitution requires. The same is true for the CPC: virtually nobody has a position.



Those firmly committed to attacking Syria, in the House, include four Republicans, five non-CPC Democrats, and CPC Co-Chair Keith Ellison. Those firmly committed against this madness include 10 Republicans, three non-CPC Democrats, and four CPC Democrats.

Ellison was first elected as an opponent of war and an advocate for impeaching George W. Bush for the crime of war, but reversed his positions immediately upon election. He just recently responded to pressure from Veterans For Peace in Minnesota and introduced into the Congressional Record acknowledgment that the Kellogg-Briand Pact bans all war. He then turned around and threw his support in behind the next war.

The other co-chair of the CPC, Raul Grijalva, is listed as “leaning nay,” along with nine other Democrats (two of them in the CPC) and 15 Republicans. We’ve learned, however, what solid commitment means to these weasels, so you can imagine what “leaning” signifies.

The CPC has no requirements for membership. A member need not hold any progressive positions. There are no required actions. A member need not oppose even the worst atrocities our government inflicts on us or the world. The CPC doesn’t fund its members’ elections in this corrupt buyer-takes-all system. A CPC member is exactly as dependent as any other Congress member on the bosses of a party, for funding, for committee positions, and for pork in a district. The CPC offers no serious megaphone for progressive views, leaving members as susceptible to the manufactured militarism of the corporate media as anyone else.

Perhaps, at long last, it’s time for Congress members Grayson, Nolan, McDermott, and Rangel to establish a Congressional Peace Caucus, which would differ from the Congressional Progressive/Pentagon Caucus. Congressman Grayson has pointed out that the Chemical Weapons Convention requires criminal prosecution for its violation — not the bombing of a country, which is itself, of course, a crime. That ought to be a simple enough position for any elected official in favor of the rule of law to grasp. If drones get to have their own caucus, why doesn’t the rule of law get one? This is, after all, the legislative branch of government.

Nearly a century ago, if a woman wanted to join the Women’s Peace Union, she had to sign a pledge, including this:

“We affirm it is our intention never to aid in or sanction war, offensive or defensive, international or civil, in any way, whether by making or handling munitions, subscribing to war loans, using our labor for the purpose of setting others free for war service, helping by money or work any organization which supports or condones war.”

A Congressional Peace Caucus, were there such a thing, might use a pledge like this:

“We affirm it is our intention never to aid in or sanction war, offensive or defensive, international or civil, in any way, but to actively oppose all war, and to seek to deny all funding for war or war preparations, and to treat the waging of war in violation of treaties to which the United States is party as an impeachable offense.”

If someone joined that caucus, even if it were just one person, I would begin to see the value in elections and caucuses that others manage to discern through the mists of pretense and sycophancy that currently enshroud Capitol Hill.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Congressional Progressive/Pentagon Caucus,"Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد",,[''],,,,
8029,3275624,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/09/caveman-credibility-and-its-costs.html,"Sending a bunch of $$3 million missiles into Syria to blow stuff up will kill a great many men, women, and children directly. It will also kill a great many people indirectly, as violence escalates in response — an established pattern recognized even by the war-promoting Washington Post.

Refugees are fleeing Syria in greater numbers as a result of the U.S. government’s threat to send in missiles. The refugees have all sorts of opinions of their government, but by many accounts they overwhelmingly oppose foreign missile strikes — a position on which they agree with a large majority in the United States.

Not only is President Obama’s proposal guaranteed to make things worse, but it risks making things dramatically worse, with threats of retaliation now coming from Syria, Iran, and Russia. The U.S. media is already describing the proposed missile strikes as “retaliatory,” even though the United States hasn’t been attacked. Imagine what the pressure will be in Washington to actually retaliate if violence leads, as it so often does, to more violence. Imagine the enthusiasm for a broader war, in Washington and Jerusalem, if Iran retaliates. Risking a major war, no matter how slim you think the chance is, ought to be done only for some incredibly important reason.



The White House doesn’t have one. President Obama’s draft resolution for Congress reads, in part:

“Whereas, the objective of the United States’ use of military force in connection with this authorization should be to deter, disrupt, prevent, and degrade the potential for, future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction; “Whereas, the conflict in Syria will only be resolved through a negotiated political settlement, and Congress calls on all parties to the conflict in Syria to participate urgently and constructively in the Geneva process;”

In other words, the missiles have nothing to do with ending the war. The war will only end through peace negotiations. All parties should “urgently” and “constructively” pursue that process. And yet, here come the missiles!

Missile strikes will enrage the Syrian government and encourage the opposition. Both sides will fight more fiercely. Both sides will be more seriously tempted to use any weapons in their arsenals. Missiles will prolong and escalate the war.

Steps toward ending the war could include: halting CIA and other military assistance; pressuring Russia and Iran, on one side, and Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states on the other, to stop arming the war; and bringing both sides to a peace conference in Geneva. Is the United States urgently and constructively taking these steps? Of course not.

What about basic humanitarian aid? The U.S. government is just not interested in providing it, not on anything remotely approaching the scale of the weaponry flowing into the war.

President Obama’s stated objective is to deter the future use of chemical weapons. But missiles may encourage that very thing by escalating the war. There are other steps that could be used to reduce the future use of chemical weapons. For one thing, the United States could stop using, developing, and stock-piling chemical weapons. Most nations do not do so. The White House and the U.S. media have begun saying that Syria holds the biggest chemical weapons supply “in the Middle East,” rather than “in the world,” as President Obama said last week. The world-record-holder is the U.S. government.

The U.S. government has admitted to using white phosphorous and new types of napalm as weapons against Iraqis. The best way to discourage that behavior is not to bomb Washington.

The U.S. government has used chemical weapons against “its own people” (always far more outrageous in the eyes of the U.S. media than killing someone else’s people) from the military’s assault on veterans in the Bonus Army to the FBI’s assault on a religious cult in Waco, Texas. The best way to discourage this behavior is not to bomb Washington.

The U.S. could also stop supporting the use of chemical weapons by certain nations, including Iraq’s use of chemical weapons against Iranians. The U.S. could sign onto and support the International Criminal Court. And the U.S. could abandon its role as top weapons supplier to the world and leading war-maker on earth. Less war means less use of all weapons, including various internationally sanctioned weapons that the United States both uses and exports, such as cluster bombs and depleted uranium.

Obama’s intention to “disrupt,” “prevent,” and “degrade” can be taken seriously only at the risk of much higher casualties, as sending missiles into supplies of chemical weapons is extremely risky.

CREDIBILITY: LA COSA NOSTRA

The purpose of missile strikes, according to the corporate U.S. media is, of course, not the reduction of chemical weapons use, but the maintenance of “credibility.”

We don’t all teach our children that when they disagree with another child on the playground they must either murder that child or lose their credibility. But our televisions and newspapers feed that type of message to us nonetheless, through news about the next possible war. Julie Pace of the Associated Press warns:

“For more than a week, the White House had been barreling toward imminent military action against Syria. But President Barack Obama’s abrupt decision to instead ask Congress for permission left him with a high-risk gamble that could devastate his credibility if no action is ultimately taken in response to a deadly chemical weapons attack that crossed his own ‘red line’.”

And here I would have thought that bombing countries in the name of “democracy” against the will of an overwhelming majority at home was costing our government what little credibility it might have had. Didn’t Britain gain in credibility when its Parliament represented its people and said “No” to war on Syria? Doesn’t that step do more for the image of democracy in Western Asia than a decade of destabilizing Iraq has done? Couldn’t the U.S. government do more for democracy by leaving Syria alone and dropping its support for brutal governments in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, etc.?

THE LAW PROBLEM



And shouldn’t a credible enforcer of the rule of law obey the law? Under no possible conception is it legal for the United States to send missiles into Syria. The Kellogg-Briand Pact bans any such action. The most common excuse for ignoring that ban is the U.N. Charter and its loopholes for wars (wars that are defensive or U.N.-authorized). A U.S. attack on Syria is not defensive, and the White House isn’t seriously pretending it is. A U.S. attack on Syria is not U.N. authorized, and the White House isn’t pretending it is or pursuing such authorization in any way. Other U.S. wars carried out in violation of these laws have put up a pretense of internationalism by cajoling some other countries to help out in minimal ways. In this case, that isn’t happening. President Obama is proposing to uphold international norms through an action that the international community of nations is against. France looks like the only possible, and at this point unlikely, partner — not counting al Qaeda, of course.

A president also cannot go to war without Congress. So, it is encouraging that President Obama has now suggested he will try to rise to the standard of George W. Bush and bother to lie to Congress before launching a war. But if Congress were to say yes, the war would remain illegal under both the U.N. Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. And if Congress were to say no, President Obama has indicated that he might just launch the war anyway.

If you look at the resolution that Obama has proposed that Congress pass, it doesn’t grant permission for a specific limited missile strike on a particular country at a particular time, but for limitless warfare, as long as some connection can be made to weapons of mass destruction in the Syrian conflict. The White House has made clear that it believes this will add exactly nothing to its powers, as it already possesses open-ended authorizations for war in the never-repealed Afghanistan and Iraq authorizations, which themselves added exactly nothing to White House war powers, because the president is given total war power through the Constitution in invisible ink that only the White House can see.

Already, there are moves in Congress to re-write Obama’s draft, in order to — in fact — give him limited powers to strike Syria. But those limited powers will allow exactly the disastrous action discussed above. And there is no reason to believe the limitation will hold. President Obama used a limited U.N. resolution to do things it never authorized in Libya. Missiles into Syria that provoke a response from Iran will provoke screams for blood out of Congress and the White House, and all laws be damned.

THE LYING PROBLEM

All of the above remains the same whether the Syrian government used chemical weapons or not. The way to end a war is to arrange a cease-fire, de-escalate, disarm, cool tensions, and start talking. Pouring gasoline on a fire doesn’t put it out. The way to uphold the rule of law is by consistent example and through prosecutions by courts, not vigilantism. This remains the case whether the Syrian government has done what President Obama claims or not.

It is important, however, that so few people around the world and in the United States are willing to take Obama’s word for it. If Obama’s goal is to “send a message,” but most people in the Middle East disagree with him on the facts, what kind of message will he possibly be sending? That is, even if his claims happen to be true, what good is that if nobody believes U.S. war justifications anymore?

The super-healthy skepticism that has now been created is not all attributable to Iraq. The world has been flooded with false claims from the U.S. government during the wars on Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and even Syria, as well as during the drone wars. Past claims that the Syrian government used chemical weapons have fallen flat. And the current claims come packages in lies, including lies about the Syrian government’s willingness to allow U.N. inspections, and the speed with which it allowed them. The U.S. government discouraged the use of inspectors, seeking to rush into war on the basis of its own assertions. The White House has produced a dodgy dossier lacking in hard evidence. Analysts see little basis for confidence in White House claims. Insiders are risking “espionage!” accusations to voice their doubts.

And should it be true that someone in the Syrian military used chemical weapons, the White House clearly has nothing but its own suspicions and desires to suggest that the order came from the top, rather than from some rogue officer with an interest in provoking an attack. Circumstantial evidence, of course, makes that more likely, given the bizarre circumstance of the incident occurring less than 10 miles from the U.N. inspectors’ hotel on the day they arrived.

Maybe it’s just too difficult to hold a proper investigation during a war. If so, that is not something to be deeply regretted. Obama’s proposed response would be disastrous. Our priority should be avoiding it and ending the war. Creating a better climate for criminal investigations is just one more reason to bring the war to an end.

THE MILITARY PROBLEM

While hawks and profiteers within and without the U.S. military favor bombing Syria and just about any other military action one might propose, many are resisting. They include the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and numerous officials risking Edward Snowden / Chelsea Manning treatment by talking to the Washington Post, and others to the New York Times. The military does not clearly understand its new proposed role as punisher of a crime that it itself regularly commits, and it does not share in Obama’s claimed confidence that a limited action will remain limited.

THE CONGRESS PROBLEM

House Speaker John Boehner asked President Obama these as-yet-mostly-unanswered questions:

· What standard did the Administration use to determine that this scope of chemical weapons use warrants potential military action? · Does the Administration consider such a response to be precedent-setting, should further humanitarian atrocities occur? · What result is the Administration seeking from its response? · What is the intended effect of the potential military strikes? · If potential strikes do not have the intended effect, will further strikes be conducted? · Would the sole purpose of a potential strike be to send a warning to the Assad regime about the use of chemical weapons? Or would a potential strike be intended to help shift the security momentum away from the regime and toward the opposition?

In fact, the White House has been clear that it has no intention to shift momentum in the war.

· If it remains unclear whether the strikes compel the Assad regime to renounce and stop the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people, or if President Assad escalates their usage, will the Administration contemplate escalatory military action? · Will your Administration conduct strikes if chemical weapons are utilized on a smaller scale? · Would you consider using the United States military to respond to situations or scenarios that do not directly involve the use or transfer of chemical weapons? · Assuming the targets of potential military strikes are restricted to the Assad inner circle and military leadership, does the Administration have contingency plans in case the strikes disrupt or throw into confusion the command and control of the regime’s weapons stocks? · Does the Administration have contingency plans if the momentum does shift away from the regime but toward terrorist organizations fighting to gain and maintain control of territory? · Does the Administration have contingency plans to deter or respond should Assad retaliate against U.S. interests or allies in the region? · Does the Administration have contingency plans should the strikes implicate foreign power interests, such as Iran or Russia?

In fact, the White House is claiming that none of these disasters will occur. But the Speaker is clearly well aware that they might.

· Does the Administration intend to submit a supplemental appropriations request to Congress, should the scope and duration of the potential military strikes exceed the initial planning?

The proposed limited strikes, using Raytheon’s $$3-million Tomahawk missiles (tastefully named for a weapon of a people the U.S. military ethnically cleansed) is expected to cost many millions and possibly $$1 billion, should nothing go wrong. That money, spent on aid for victims of this war, rather than on escalating the violence, could save a large number of lives. Failure to so spend it is an immoral act.

TAKING ACTION

Over 40,000 people already chose to click here to tell Congress and the president not to attack Syria.

Already it’s making a difference. Our actions so far have helped compel President Obama to seek Congressional authorization before any attack.

Now we have a week to work with. We start with a majority of the public on our side. We have to hold off a flood of pro-war propaganda, and we have to compel Congress to represent us. And we can do this.

The first step is to click here and add your voice.

Second, please send this to everyone you think might add their voice as well.

Third, organize locally to pressure your Congress member and senators, while they are in their districts and states this week, to commit to voting “No” on a U.S. attack on Syria.

We who reject arguments for war are a majority now. We are a majority in Britain, where Parliament has already voted “No.” We are a majority in Germany, which will not take part. We are a majority in France, where Parliament will be heard from soon. And we are a majority in the United States. Let Congress hear from you now!

The terrible and widespread killing in Syria will become even more terrible and more widespread if the U.S. military launches an attack. The White House has no proposal to win a war, only to inject greater violence into a war, prolonging and escalating it.

Contrary to White House claims, Congress cannot authorize war and support a peace process at the same time. Escalating the violence will block, rather than facilitate, peace. Congress is going to have to choose.

Albert Camus summarized the choice now before us: “In such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, not to be on the side of the executioners.”

Click here to oppose a military attack on Syria, and to urge Congress and the president instead to work for a ceasefire, to pressure Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, and Turkey, to halt the flow of weapons, and to pressure Russia and Iran to do the same.

8030,3275625,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/04/low-level-doses-of-radiation-can-cause-big-problems.html,"This is an expanded version of an article I wrote a couple of days ago.

When scientists speak of radiation, they speak not only of single doses but also of cumulative doses.

See for example, this research from the University of Iowa showing that “cumulative radon exposure is a significant risk factor for lung cancer in women”.

And see these studies on the health effects cumulative doses of radioactive cesium. (As I noted on March 29th, the radioactive cesium fallout from Japan already rivals Chernobyl. And the amount of radioactive fuel at Fukushima dwarfs Chernobyl).

Admittedly, the damage from huge single doses may be greater than the same cumulative dose from many small exposures. But the smaller doses can still add up.

Many studies have shown that repeated exposures to low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans and x-rays can cause cancer. See this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this and this.

Remember, the radiation from CT scans and x-rays are external emitters – the radiation emanates from outside the body. In contract, internal emitters keep emitting their radiation inside the body. Therefore, the cumulative effect of multiple small doses of radiation from internal emitters could be even more dramatic, depending on the half life, metabolic pathways and other properties of the particular radioactive particle.

As the European Committee on Radiation Risk notes:

Cumulative impacts of chronic irradiation in low doses are … important for the comprehension, assessment and prognosis of the late effects of irradiation on human beings …

And see this.

One of the World’s Leading Experts on Radiation – Karl Morgan – Warned of Cumulative Low-Dose Exposures

American reporter Dahr Jamail reports today for Al Jazeera:

“The U.S. Department of Energy has testified that there is no level of radiation that is so low that it is without health risks,” Jacqueline Cabasso, the Executive Director of the Western States Legal Foundation, told Al Jazeera. Her foundation monitors and analyzes U.S. nuclear weapons programs and policies and related high technology energy, with a focus on the national nuclear weapons laboratories. Cabasso explained that natural background radiation exists, “But more than 2,000 nuclear tests have enhanced this background radiation level, so we are already living in an artificially radiated environment due to all the nuclear tests.” “Karl Morgan, who worked on the Manhattan project, later came out against the nuclear industry when he understood the danger of low levels of ionizing radiation-and he said there is no safe dose of radiation exposure,” Cabasso continued, “That means all this talk about what a worker or the public can withstand on a yearly basis is bogus. There is no safe level of radiation exposure. These so-called safe levels are coming from within the nuclear establishment.” Karl Morgan was an American physicist who was a founder of the field of radiation health physics. After a long career in the Manhattan Project and at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, he became a critic of nuclear power and weapons. Morgan, who died in 1999, began to offer court testimony for people who said they had been harmed by the nuclear power industry. “Nobody is talking about the fact that there is no safe dose of radiation,” Cabasso added, “One of the reasons Morgan said this is because doses are cumulative in the body.”

Indeed, Karl Morgan believed that the officially-defined “permissible levels” of radiation – which he helped to create on behalf of the government – are much higher than they should be.

As the Guardian wrote in Morgan’s obituary in 1999:

Karl Morgan … was a pioneer of health physics – the science of the effect of exposure to radiation on health. He was a member of the research group which laid the foundations for the Manhattan project and produced the first atomic bomb. However, after 30 years in the inner cabinet of the nuclear establishment, Morgan changed sides and testified in key radiation cases on behalf of those who claimed they had been harmed by nuclear weapons and the nuclear power industry. The first signs of his change of view came in 1968, when he became an influential campaigner in obtaining a US law that required the medical profession to control excessive doses of radiation during X-rays. After retirement in 1972 he became more active in drawing attention to the limitations of radiation protection measures. *** He began his career as a physics professor but in 1943 was recruited to become a senior scientist in health physics to the top secret, atomic bomb project codenamed Manhattan Engineer District. The following year, Morgan went to the newly-formed Oak Ridge national laboratory in Tennessee, where he became director of health physics from 1944 until his retirement. When told he would be in the health physics group, he was shocked and said it was a terrible mistake because he had never heard of health physics. The leaders of the research project said they had been in the same position. But they realised that since their attempts to build the first atomic pile, now known as a reactor, would create a source of intense radiation, they needed to understand how to protect people. *** He wrote in his autobiography, The Angry Genie: One Man’s Walk Through The Nuclear Age, that he did not believe they had ever determined that it was safe. “We determined what we considered was acceptable.”

The Townsend Letter for Doctors & Patients wrote in 2002:

One of the original five ‘health physicists’ to set radiation safety standards was Karl Z. Morgan. Dr. Morgan served on the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), which set up most radiation standards. He also directed the Health Physics Division at Oak Ridge from 1944 until his retirement in 1972. In recent years, Dr. Morgan has publicly criticized the ICRP for failing to protect human health. In a 1994 article for the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, Dr. Morgan wrote: “The period of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons by the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the USSR is a sad page in the history of civilized man. Without question, it was the cause of hundreds of thousands of cancer deaths. Yet there was complete silence on the part of the ICRP. During these years (1960-1965), most members of the ICRP either worked directly with the nuclear weapons industry or indirectly received most of their funding for their research from this industry.” The ICRP’s alliance with the nuclear industry includes ties to the International Congress of Radiology. In his 1999 autobiography, The Angry Genie: One Man’s Walk Through the Nuclear Age (ISBN 0-8061-3122-5), Dr. Morgan related his concern about the ICRP’s refusal to address the danger of excessive X-ray exposure during diagnostic procedures and dentistry. Until the passage of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, some X-ray equipment used in the 1950s and 1960s delivered 2 to 3 rem per X-ray. X-ray doses as low as 1.6 rem increase a woman’s chance of developing cancer, according to a 1974 study by Baruch Modan [Lancet (Feb. 23,1974), pp 277-279]. The Act did not address the cumulative effect of multiple, routine, and often unnecessary X-rays.

Other Top Radiation Experts Agree



By any measure, Dr. John Gofman was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century. Gofman earned his doctorate in nuclear and physical chemistry, and was also a medical doctor. He worked on the Manhattan Project, co-discovered uranium-232 and -233 and proved their fissionability, helped discover how to extract plutonium and led the team that discovered and characterized lipoproteins in the causation of heart disease.

Dr. Arthur R. Tamplin was a doctor of biophysics, who was tasked – as a group leader in the Biomedical Division at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories – with predicting the ultimate distribution within the biosphere and in humans of each radionuclide produced in the explosion of a nuclear device.

In 1963 the Atomic Energy Commission asked Gofman and Tamplin to undertake a series of long range studies on potential dangers that might arise from the “peaceful uses of the atom.” They told the truth, and the AEC launched a campaign of harassment in response.

What did they say, and why was the AEC so hostile?

Gofman and Tamplin documented that low levels of radiation can cause cancer and other diseases, and they argued that federal safety guidelines for low-level exposures should be reduced by 90 percent.

Ernest Sternglass (Emeritus Professor of Radiological Physics in the Department of Radiology, at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine), Dr. Alice Stewart (head of the Department of Preventive Medicine of Oxford University) and many other top scientists have also shown that low level radiation can cause cancer.

Military Commanders Told that Low-Level Radiation Increases the Risk of Cancer

A military briefing written by the U.S. Army for commanders in Iraq states:

Hazards from low level radiation are long-term, not acute effects… Every exposure increases risk of cancer.

(Military briefings for commanders often contain less propaganda than literature aimed at civilians, as the commanders have to know the basic facts to be able to assess risk to their soldiers.)

The briefing states that doses are cumulative, citing the following military studies and reports:

ACE Directive 80-63, ACE Policy for Defensive Measures against Low Level Radiological Hazards during Military Operations, 2 AUG 96

AR 11-9, The Army Radiation Program, 28 MAY 99

FM 4-02.283, Treatment of Nuclear and Radiological Casualties, 20 DEC 01

JP 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in NBC Environments, 11 JUL 00

NATO STANAG 2473, Command Guidance on Low Level Radiation Exposure in Military Operations, 3 MAY 00

USACHPPM TG 244, The NBC Battle Book, AUG 02

Why was the military advising commanders on radiation in Iraq? Presumably because the American military used depleted uranium in Iraq (see this, this, this, this, this and this).

Infants Are Most at Risk

Infants are, apparently, most vulnerable to low level radiation exposure.

Thank Timothy Geithner, the Obama admin, and Ben ""helicopter"" Bernake for silencing the banks and keeping the men and woman who help put Obama in power, in the dark.

8035,3275630,dailykos.com,political,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2006/10/3/252923/-Dobson-s-Jesus-Camp,"I lived near Dallas Texas for many years, and as one can expect, there's a dogged supersaturation of fundamentalist radio in the area. My Significant Other (of the time) became addicted to religious radio, and consequently I regularly heard Focus on the Family programs. Since we had kids in the house, she also saw fit to expose them to their kid show, ""Adventures in Odyssey."" This is well-produced radio theater, with generally laudable voice work and some clean narrative writing.

Odyssey could at times be genuinely heart-warming, if simplistic. But quite often you saw a rather clumsy effort, in the midst of the Clinton boom `90s, to inoculate a new generation of kids against questioning authority; questioning biblical nonsense, cloak-and-dagger elitism, and general imperial, heavy-power behavior by their political betters. It's strange to say, but it sometimes took on the appearance of direct reaction to `60s Berkeley, or `80s consciousness-raising over the contra question.

It may sound like I'm overstating, but I'm not. Chubby, pink-cheeked li'l skeezers sitting around the radio in the `90s to find out what hijinx ""Whit"" and the gang would get into this week were not likely to possess the kind of cultural context needed to parse some of the political stuff they would hear; and their fundie parents were not bloody likely to provide it. Sometimes it felt like the writers were purging their own demons of remorse over their own earlier rebellion against God's established authorities. The results didn't always ring like a fine narrative bell!

In short, a significant component of the action in the `90s ""Adventures in Odyssey"" episodes seemed bent on explicitly redressing putative wrongs imposed on elites by ""counterculture"" revisionists.

Here's a sampling of some of these themes from past Odyssey episodes:



A little boy has intense fantasies about being a fighter pilot, like his father who died in action in Vietnam. His fantasy is ""shot down"" by a history teacher who gives him a text to read which is apparently critical of our Vietnam involvement--though we never hear anything from the text that can be submitted to reasoned judgment. The teacher is subsequently upbraided by ""Whit"" for failing to uphold the values of honor and dignified service--though we never get to find out what's honorable about visiting years of superior firepower on rice farmers, or what's dishonorable about a history text which (perhaps; hard to say) could plausibly seek to put Vietnam in some kind of a moral context. The straw dog teacher crumples before Whit's posturing. They also throw in flashbacks to another straw dog ""hippie"" character whose opposition to the war is pretty much indistinguishable from a wimpy, groovy, and generally out-of-it lifestyle.



A boy is questioning giving money in church to support missionaries, then has an extended, Scrooge-like vivid dream about visiting a struggling missionary to the Miskito people in Nicaragua. You'd think the focus would be on Christ's legacy of serving people in need, but the piece turns out to be largely a Trojan Horse rehash of a strained apologetic for unquestioned support for Reagan's contras.



""Whit,"" an older, semi-retired man, runs an ice cream soda shop, and hands-on science and technology play-space for the kids of the town of Odyssey. Oh. Did I mention that he's also a spook on the CIA payroll who sometimes hands control to trusted underage employees while he's out on assignments whose purposes are not even hazily contoured in the scripts? It was likely conjured up by the screenwriters to avail the ailing Hal Smith opportunities to get some needed R&R, but you have to admit it's a weird-ass dodge to choose.



But to show this spook angle was something of an idée fixe, there are two other adult characters in the scripts who are CIA spooks, fall deeply in love, and naturally, ardently seek to place these feelings into a scriptural context. Sexy! Again, we never learn what their assignments were. So what is the metamessage behind these bizarre, otherworldly little vacuums in these plotlines? If fleshing in these bits doesn't figure in to the scriptwriters' sense of narrative balance, who are you to think that official secrets are any of your business? If concern about this even shows up on your screen, you may not be the good little soldier of God you think you are. Mindlessly absorbing these subtexts is good practice for a placid future life blocking out perpetual outrages committed against the principles of civil government in some Christian police state--or could that be state in which we find ourselves presently? The universal solvent that dissolves the salts of moral accountability would appear to be Jesus. Our lesson for today?: Jesus Christ gives you a moral free ride, which translates into never having to tell anyone what's really happening, or what you're really doing. Bush's illegal spy program--and the harrowing reality that ""Christian"" middle America doesn't give a shit about it-- dovetails perfectly.



You may be asking, why did I let my kids listen to this pernicious stuff? Well, the first reason is that my kids were also my wife's kids, and marriage is necessarily compromise. In my defense, remember that she is my-wife.

Also, I recall an exchange with a fundamentalist brother-in-law who questioned how my wife and I could function as a parental team, what with our disparity of outlook on these kinds of issues. I countered with the obvious: If my wife and I were in total, ""ideal"" accord on such things, who would teach our kids certain valuable lessons, such as the necessity to develop as free, moral agents, continually and earnestly evaluating the barrage of messages from authority figures, using one's best lights. In the words of my eldest, when I told her, ""Question authority!"" she said, ""Why?""

See? It worked!

Anyway, the reason I sat down to pen this stuff is because I suspect there are very few progressives out there who know anything about Dobson & Co. beyond the occasional sound-bite belligerence from the muckety mucks. But I think people need to be aware of this other ugly aspect of FotF; the world where they furtively seek to strip the next generation of the skills needed to evaluate state pronouncements and behavior in a timely manner; a world where charming children's radio entertainment aids and abets fundamentalist parents in their effort to program their kids to accept affective response to government signals as a surrogate for real morality; a world you would know only if you were strapped to a chair and forced to listen, or if you were married to a fundamentalist.

There are more topics that I could treat; such as weird, seemingly self-conscious radio segments that addressed specific skeptical dismissals of Bible passages. One message comes through clearly: Deep down, these folks know they're trying harder than they would have to if God was truly on their sides

More, later. Perhaps.

8039,3275634,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,http://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/duration%20of%20unemployment,"Throughout recent years, the recovery meme, played across the mainstream media in the U.S. has provided endless support to President Obama’s approval ratings. During POTUS 2016 election, the said meme was used by Hillary Clinton to challenge the ‘things aren’t so great in America’ views of Bernie Sanders and, subsequently, the echoes of the same from Donald Trump. Since the election, the recovery story has been billed as the ‘strong economy’ legacy that President Obama will be leaving for his predecessor to mess with - the basis for setting up the incoming Trump Administration for any potential fall, should economic fortunes of the recovery were to falter.The central point of the U.S. recovery story - absent any appreciable growth in productivity, capital investment, and sectoral value added - was the only bright spot on the U.S. economic horizon: the labour markets. In fact, the U.S. headline unemployment figures have shown very strong gains, and jobs creation has been robust, with more recent data showing improvements (at long last) in households’ incomes. All of these indicators can and have been robustly challenged in terms of the extent to which they show true nature of improvements. However, they have been taken, predominantly, as read. Improvements are improvements, and gains are gains.And as the readers of my blog and media articles would have known, the story is never complete, if one looks only at headline figures. Reality is always more complex.So to show you this complexity at work, let’s look at one official indicator of the health of the labour markets in the U.S. - duration of unemployment. If the U.S. economy is really awash with jobs, and if the true unemployment rate is really sitting at 4.9 percent, the duration of unemployment should not only be declining on average, but it should be closer to ‘normal’ non-recessionary reading. Right?Take a look at the following chart based on data from the St Louis Federal Reserve database, Fred:Yes, duration of unemployment peaked in January 2011 at 40.7 weeks and since then fallen to 26.3 weeks (as of November 2016), but 26.3 weeks for average unemployment benefits duration is still above any previous recession since 1948 on.Now, as er return to normalcy. During 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, recovery failed to completely reduce average duration of unemployment back to pre-recessionary norms. In simple terms, after the end of recession, in 1990-1991 and 2001 downturns, on average, unemployed people remained in unemployment longer than before recessions. These were the first two recession on record that resulted in this change in structural unemployment duration.Now, consider 2008 recession. Chart below illustrates what happened to the ‘new normal’ duration of unemployment spells. Specifically, chart below plots the difference between average duration of unemployment during recession and recovery and the average duration of unemployment in 12 months prior to the onset of each recession. Returning to normal here would mean getting duration gap closer to zero.Again, current (since 2008) recovery is clearly the worst for all post-recessionary episodes on record. Currently, duration of unemployment is 9.5 weeks, on average, longer than it was during the last 12 months of pre-2008 recession. Which is bad enough to be worse than the peak deviation for any recession in modern history.What is happening here? The fabled U.S. jobs creation recovery is really a combination of several factors. One of these is genuine increases in jobs being created, which drives unemployment down. Another is demographic: U.S. labour force is expanding, and as it does, employment creation get swallowed by new entrants into labour force, while many existent unemployed are either exiting the labour force, or remaining on unemployment benefits longer. Of course, putting younger workers to work is a good thing. But squeezing older unemployed out of workforce is not.There are serious problems with highly elevated (to-date) duration of U.S. unemployment that few politicians are willing to talk about. For one, longer duration of unemployment implies lower probability of transition into employment. Secondly, it also implies higher probability of future unemployment in future recessions. Thirdly, it implies more severe losses in skills, human capital, health, social well-being, etc. In other words, costs of unemployment rise faster for longer duration of unemployment.Which makes you pause and think: is the legacy of the Obama administration on jobs is that impressive? Really? Well, stay tuned for more...",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","America's Scariest Chart, US unemployment, Probability of Finding a Job, QNHS, Exclusive Irish Economy, duration of unemployment, Irish unemployment, US employment, Great Recession, human capital, employment by sector, Irish employment, employment index, Government score card, long-term unemployment, labour force participation, Government scorecard, unemployment by age, Long Term Unemployment, average duration",,

If you want a frightening figure for the start of the week, If you want a frightening figure for the start of the week, here's one, courtesy of the WSJ:









Per WSJ: "" At least 90% of the €65 billion ($$85.7 billion) fund has been invested in increasingly risky Spanish debt, according to official figures, and the government has begun withdrawing cash for emergency payments.""



"" In November, the government withdrew €4 billion from the reserve fund to pay pensions, the second time in history it had withdrawn cash. The first time was in September, when it took €3 billion to cover unspecified treasury needs."" Such withdrawals can lead to sales of bonds, which in turn can lead to higher yields - classic scenario of a ponzi scheme unwinding.



The point is not valuations, but risk.



""Spain will have trouble finding buyers for the estimated €207 billion in debt it plans to issue in 2013, up from €186 billion in 2012, to cover central-government operations, debt maturities of 17 regional administrations, and overdue energy bills,"" according to WSJ.



But there is, of course, more. "" Spain's commercial banks already have increased their Spanish government-bond portfolio by a factor of six since the start of the crisis in 2008, and now own one-third of government bonds in circulation."" In other words, there is a closed loop between Spanish State, State pensions fund and the banks. A liquidity crunch or solvency problems for banks will cascade all across the debt markets, potentially triggering defaults on pensions.

8041,3275636,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,http://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/Portugal%20deficit,"In 2012 we expect to post a Government deficit of 8.30% of GDP against Greece's deficit of 7.52%, Portugal's 4.99% and Spain's 6.99%. We are 'special' in so far as we will have the highest deficit of all peripheral countries.

In 2013, Ireland is forecast to post a Government deficit of 7.52% of GDP against Greece's 4.67%, Portugal's 4.48% and Spain's 5.67%. Once again, 'special' allegedly means the 'worst performing'.

In 2012, Ireland's structural deficit would have fallen from 9.31% of potential GDP in 2010 to 6.15% - a decline of 3.16 ppt. For Greece, the same numbers are 12.12% to 4.53% - a decline of 7.59 ppt or more than double the rate of austerity than in Ireland. For Portugal, these numbers are 8.96% to 4.09% - a decline of 4.87 ppt of more than 50% deeper reduction than in Ireland. For Spain: 7.32% to 5.39% - a drop of 1.93 ppt or shallower than that for Ireland.

In 2013 in terms of structural deficit, Ireland (5.38% of potential GDP deficit) will be worse off than Greece (-1.06% of potential GDP), Portugal (2.28%) and Spain (3.52%)





Now, run by me what is so 'special' about Ireland's fiscal adjustment case?





Can it be that we are 'lighter' than other peripherals on debt?

2010 Government debt in Ireland stood at 92.175% of GDP and this year it will be around 117.743% - up 25.255% of GDP. For Greece this was respectively 144.55% of GDP in 2010 and 170.731% in 2012 - a rise of 26.181%, marginally faster than that for Ireland. For Portugal, gross Government debt was 93.32% of GDP in 2010 and that rose to 119.066% in 2012, an increase of 25.746%. Again, not far from Ireland's. And for Spain, these numbers were 61.316% to 90.693% - a rise of 29.377%. So while Spain is clearly the worst performer in the class, Ireland, Greece and Portugal are not that far off from each other. Wait, what about economic reforms and internal devaluations? Surely here Ireland, with its exports-focused economy is a 'special' case?

In 2012, Ireland is expected to post a current account surplus of 1.813% of GDP, against deficits of between 0.148% and 2.909% for the other three peripheral countries. This, of course, is not the legacy of Irish reforms, but of the MNCs operating from here.

However, in terms of current account dynamics, Ireland is not that special. Between 2010 and 2012, Greece will reduce its current account deficit by 4.294 ppt, Ireland will improve its external balance by 0.674 ppt, Portugal by 7.105 ppt and Spain by 2.278 ppt. So Ireland is the worst performing country of four in terms of current account dynamics, while the best performing in terms of current account balance. Now, do run by me what can it possibly mean for Ireland to be a 'special' case compared to Greece, Portugal and Spain?

Since the disastrously vacuous summit last Thursday and Friday, there has been a barrage of 'Ireland is special' statements from Merkel and other political leaders. The alleged 'special' nature of Ireland compared to Greece, Portugal and Spain is, supposedly, reflected in Irish banks being successfully repaired and Irish fiscal crisis corrected to a stronger health position than that of the other peripheral countries.I am not going to make a comment on the banking system's functionality in Ireland compared to other states. But on the fiscal front, let's take a look. Per IMF:",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Irish crisis, Spanish deficits, Irish fiscal reforms, Ireland special case, Greek deficits, Irish fiscal policies, Irish structural deficit, Portugal deficit",,
8042,3275637,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,http://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/Greek%20deficits,"Some time ago I promised to publish some long term macroeconomic comparatives for Ireland relative to other small open economies of Europe. Here they are (all data is courtesy of the IMF's Global Economic Outlook dataset with some forecasts adjusted to reflect Government own forecasts in Budget 2010):First output gap as percent of potential GDPThere is really no doubting who's worse off in this picture. And notice how much more dramatic is our output gap volatility compared to, say, Austria - another small, but more stable economy, despite it having a massive exposure to high growth and high volatility Eastern and Central European countries.Next, we have GDP per capita. Several features of the chart are worth highlighting.Obviously, Iceland is now on the path, per IMF to close the gap between themselves and us in terms of GDP per capita. Dynamics-wise, it is expected to do better relative to Ireland than it ever did in the period since the late 1990s through the bubble. Taking medicine on time and in full, obviously pays for Iceland. Back in 1999 Ireland moved onto a path of GDP per capita in excess of Iceland. In 2009 it moved on the path of GDP per capita converging with Iceland.Who's doing better here? By the end of 2014, Iceland is expected by the IMF to fully recover from the crisis, reaching peak GDP per capita once again, after a shorter recession than the one enjoyed by Ireland. And Iceland will do so with faster growth in population than Ireland will (see later charts).Under DofF dreamy assumptions, Ireland too will reach its pre-crisis peak by 2014, but it would have taken us a year longer to get there than Iceland. And this is under DofF assumptions.Now, I also provide my own forecast - somewhat gloomier than that of the Government - which implies that i do not expect Ireland to reach the pre-crisis peak income per capita any time soon. And this dynamic will be paralleled by a slower growing population.Also, do remember - our GDP is not a measure of our income (GNP is), while for Icelanders the two measures are more closely related.Next inflation as measured by CPI: Do tell me we are just fine with 5% deflation in the current cycle. Not really, folks. In order to get us back to price levels that imply competitiveness, we need a good 40% deflation if not more.Unemployment - the one that we are being told is getting better now that 'the worst is already behind us' per official Government view: Again, think Iceland and Greece. Greece is a good one in particular - their unemployment was high since the late 1980s. Ours was low since the mid 1990s and sub-zero since 2001. But, thanks to our 'head-in-the-sand' economic policies during the current crisis - we are now at the top of the league.Demographics - some say this is our saving grace, the golden 'get-out-of-the-slump' card: Nothing spectacular that I can spot here. And these are IMF projections that lag in incorporating what we, on the ground already know - the rapid depletion of our foreign workers' population and waves of young Irish people leaving the country.Let's take a look at employment (as opposed to unemployment) as % of the total population. basically, the higher the number, the lower is the country dependency ratio (in other words, the greater is the number of people working than the number of people they support): We were doing pretty well - just below Iceland and Switzerland. Post crisis, Iceland will retain its second best position, but we will slide below Lux. Again, this is in the environment where our population will be growing slower than that of Lux...General Government Balance: Well, yes - per Brian Lenihan we have taken the necessary steps... Did we? How is fooling who here? Iceland will be ahead of us with default and without a mountain of international bondholders' and depositors' liabilities on the shoulders of its people. We will both, destroy our public finances and our private households' finances as well. All for what? To make sure we do not upset banks bond holders? But wait - these figures do not reflect Nama and its cost. They do not reflect future bank recapitalisations. Were they to do so, our Government Balance would have fallen way beyond 16-18% mark.But let us take a different look at the same figure: Now, remember all the talk about Charlie McCreevy being a profligate spender as the Minister for Finance. Actually, not really. Over his tenure - longer than that of his successor, McCreevy presided over relatively mild deterioration in fiscal position. Primary balance under McCreevy in cumulative terms was close to break even. Under Minister Cowen things spun out of hand. Noticeably, Minister Lenihan is doing a much better job than his predecessor, although it is hard to say whether he is doing it because he actually believes in some sort of fiscal discipline or because he simply cannot borrow all the money he would like to borrow.Current account balance: For an economy that is staking its survival on exports (and we really do not have much of hope of doing otherwise), we are not looking all too strong in 2010-2014 projections by the IMF. Iceland, in contrast, is looking mighty alright relative to us, having undergone massive devaluation. Again, our deflation at home is simply not enough to compensate for the fact that we cannot devalue the grossly expensive euro.Let me take you through more comparatives. Back to Government deficits. Now, recall there are two components to deficit - structural (due to chronic overspend) and cyclical (due to a recession). Again, notice how Greece and Austria are on virtually identical path, although Greece is above Austria. This means that on average, the share of their overall deficit that is structural is relatively the same. If Greeks were to cut their structural deficit relative to its position today, their overall deficit will decline by a lower percentage than the same drop for Ireland. In Ireland's case, we have smaller cyclical deficit than the Greeks do, but greater structural deficits. Relative to Austrians, we are simply a drunken sailor hitting the first pub on the shore.Take a closer look at the Irish data alone: In the 1980s through late 1990s - much lower structural deficits than since 1998. Why? I guess Bertie really was a profligately spending socialist of the old variety.Last chart: just to drive home the same point as before: Note the dramatic deterioration in structural balances under Mr Cowen - throughout his years as Minister for Finance, he was spending not only the money he had (shallower surpluses than his predecessor), but also the money he did not have (deeper structural deficits), leveraging lavishly future generations' wealth. Mr McCreevy, in contrast, really was spending what he had, with structural deficits starting to cause problems in his tenure only around 2002. And one last point to make - notice how our structural deficit has caught up with its 5-year moving average line. This suggests that even in the Budget 2010 we still did not do enough to reverse longer term trend leading us deeper and deeper into permanent insolvency.Paraphrasing Fianna Fáil's 2002 general election slogan: ""A Little Done, More To Do""...",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Irish fiscal policy, Irish economy, Irish deficit, Celtic Tiger, Greek deficits, Irish growth, ECB rescue, Irish fiscal reforms, Portugal deficit, Greek crisis, Irish crisis, Spanish deficits, Greek bonds, Greece Ireland, Greece Germany, Crisis Euro area, Irish deficits, Irish fiscal policies, Euro crisis, Exclusive Irish Economy, Ireland special case, Charlie McCreevy, Irish structural deficit",,

He killed the Emperor and his mother, installed the Emperor's 9-year-old kid brother, and assumed the Emperor's powers.

Few people failed to resent this usurpation, and it was made incrementally more galling by Dong Zhuo's overt tyrannical abuses; daring to sleep in the Emperor's sacred ""dragon bed,"" ordering people about on shameless whims. The situation was intolerable, but seemingly hopeless.

At this time there was a brash young field officer, named Tsao Tsao, admired and trusted by Dong Zhuo. Tsao Tsao privately hated Dong Zhuo as much as anyone, if not more, and saw himself in an ideal position to singlehandedly address the situation.

Prime Minister Wang Yun liked the cut of Tsao Tsao's jib, and together they formed a plan.

Wang Yun gave Tsao Tsao an ancestral battle sword, a Qi Xing, ""seven stars,"" so-named because it's shaped like the Big Dipper. Tsao Tsao would meet Dong Zhuo to present the sword privately, and use the occasion--and the sword--to assassinate him.

Everything was going fairly to plan. Tsao Tsao was admitted into Dong Zhuo's private chamber, with the sword. Dong Zhuo had sent his strong man, Lu Bu, out to the stables to get Tsao Tsao a fresh Mongol horse as a gift. Dong Zhuo laid down on his divan and turned away to call out some further instructions to Lu Bu; neck exposed, a perfect target. But Tsao Tsao hesitated, and the moment was lost; and it was only by dint of some good acting and fast talking that he was able to high-tail it out of there and get away with his life.

After about 5.6 seconds of reflection on the strange circumstance, Dong Zhuo was able to make sense of Tsao Tsao's over-hasty retreat; it was a failed assassination attempt!

Dong Zhuo had dead-or-alive ""wanted"" posters immediately drawn up and posted throughout the country.

Well, you can imagine that these posters could have two effects; alerting Dong Zhuo's partisans that a malefactor was at-large, but also informing the larger populace that a nascent national savior was in their midst. Fortunately for Tsao Tsao, he encountered the latter before the former, and took refuge in the home of Chen Gong, who agreed that Dong Zhou had the country on the fast track to wrack and ruin, and sympathized with Tsao Tsao's plight.

So Tsao Tsao was safe, for the time being. But how safe was he, really? He knew that Dong Zhuo's soldiers were combing the towns and countryside looking for him; and when they found him, they'd kill him on the spot. He grew more and more paranoid.

He considered putting together an army, and to this end, he and Chen Gong traveled by night together to the home of Lu Bo She. When he heard Tsao Tsao's story, he was deeply moved, and sought to treat his guests honorably, saying he'd go out to get a bottle of wine and would be right back.

So Tsao Tsao was left alone in the room with Chen Gong. Tsao Tsao heard the sound of a knife on a grindstone in the adjacent backyard. The two men crept over to the wall to listen more closely.

They overheard a man saying, ""Why don't we just tie him up and slit his throat?""

Tsao Tsao cocked an eye at Chen Gong and whispered, ""They're planning to kill us! We have to act now!""

They rushed into the backyard and, with no regard for the gender or apparent station of their victims, killed eight men and women with their knives.

Mere seconds after the deed was done, Chen Gong looked over in the corner and noticed a fat pig--no doubt to be offered as a succulent repast for the honored guests--trussed up and ready for the slaughter. It immediately became clear to him that they'd murdered eight innocent people in a funk-blinded panic, and he cried out ""My God! So much death to assuage an ounce of suspicion!""

---------------------

At this point, I took stock of everything I'd come to know about Tsao Tsao. He was seen as a brave, heroic, idealistic young buck by his peers and betters in the feudal system. He was tapped as ""a natural"" to achieve the short-term goal of eliminating a tyrant. But what we find out is that; he didn't really have the stick-to-itiveness to follow through on this initial mission; the fear-thwarted initial short-term fix balloons into an arguably self-preserving plan to seek safety in numbers by assembling an army; and the first time his fevered, fearful, self-serving mind is confronted with a dimly perceived threat to his personal well-being, massive wrongful death in the household of a personal partisan is the fruit.

This--with, I think, a modicum of wrangling--is the Blackwater story.

There's a simple lesson here: Brave people shoot last. It's the cowards who shoot first.

Although Tsao Tsao had found himself in a position to have powerful people around him mistake him for a brave man, he was in fact a coward. What is the nature of the blindness that can cause such a mistake in judgment by elite decision-makers? A mistake like this reflects a stark paucity of values, and of moral and character discrimination.

I think this points to the fundamental error of judgment which posits fear as a force that can be directed to desirable ends. Blackwater's techniques are based on inducing fear to affect the ""safety"" of their charges. But what is the long-term effect? Iraqis, rightfully, conflate the U.S. Army with our hired guns. When someone you love is killed, it doesn't make you feel better--let alone more ""on the road to Democracy""--to know that they were killed by a free-market cost/benefit analysis which abstracted the short-term goals of escorting someone through a war zone from long-term Iraqi interests.

In the end, this approach results in panic. This is not the panic which pops up as the classic random factor in the chaos of war, but rather as a predictable outcome when inducement of fear and self-preservation is standard operating procedure.

Our political masters of all stripes feel compelled to frequently intone the reassurance that the men and women of our volunteer military are ""brave."" And maybe many, if not most, of them are.

What this has to do with the Blackwater, et.al, shadow army is another matter; a matter which is in dire need of political redress.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,"Tsao Tsao, Cowardice, and Blackwater","Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,

Who is this guy? Is he a Muslim? Is he different? Is he one of us?

Who is this gregarious bloviator on MSNBC? Is he a Catholic? Is he different? Is he one of us?

Also, back in September, Chris Matthews put forth the Cory Hart sunglasses test:

Can Barack Obama, a man of elite education if not elite background, break into the middle class and talk regular? Can he talk to regular people in their kitchens tonight, in their living rooms? [...] Everybody thinks Barack is too cool. In other words, there he is with the shades, getting on the plane. A little bit too elegant, a little bit too proud of his own bearing. Is that a problem, that he's just too cool for words. In other words, elite.

Let's examine whether Chris Matthews passes this muster. Chris Mathews makes five million dollars a year from his show. He also wrote some books. But what about the critical question of sunglasses?

Ouch. That's going to cost him some hardworking votes.

In April, Mathews asked McCain some tough questions (tough on Obama) that could be applicable to his own candidacy, such as: ""Is Obama an elitist?""

Again, Chris Matthews makes five million dollars a year, which is rich by even McCain’s standards. And he vacations in Paris, owns a house in Chevy Chase and sports a cackle that reeks of ""latte-sipper."" So put a big X mark next to that question.

According to his own criteria, Chris Matthews doesn't appear up to the task of political office. But he still has time. Maybe he can give himself an image makeover.

8052,3275649,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,https://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/Iceland%20and%20Ireland,"This is the first post of two dealing with comparatives between Irish and Icelandic economies during the ongoing crises. The post was motivated by a number of recent articles in Irish press presenting Irish situation in terms of the allegedly stronger crisis performance than Iceland, as well as Paul Krugman's response to these ( here ). This post will deal with real economy comparatives, while the second post will deal with fiscal performance relatives.Both economies experienced deep crises in 2008-2010: Icelandic economy contracted to 90.41% of 2007 levels by the end of 2010, while Irish economy declined to 92.13%. Per IMF Q4 2010 forecasts, Icelandic economy is likely to reach 103.12% of its 2007 level GDP by 2015 while Irish economy is expected to reach 106.10%. However, latest revisions to 2011 forecasts (but not yet to 2011-2015 period) suggest that this advantage of the Irish economy over Icelandic economy is unlikely to hold.In terms of real GDP per capita Icelandic economy contracted to 88.64% of 2007 levels by the end of 2010, while Irish economy declined to 91.08%. Per IMF Q4 2010 forecasts, Icelandic economy is likely to reach 98.05% of its 2007 level GDP by 2015 while Irish economy is expected to reach 106.10%. Again, latest revisions to 2011 forecasts (but not yet to 2011-2015 period) suggest that this advantage of the Irish economy over Icelandic economy is unlikely to hold in the next IMF database updates.In terms of GDP based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) per capita, Current international dollars, Irish economy has contracted by 10.25% in 2010 relative to 2007, while Icelandic economy declined by 7.75% - much less. Why? This result is especially worrisome, given that over the same period Irish economy experienced deep deflation (see below), while Icelandic currency was devalued substantially. Thus, Irish purchasing power should have risen, while Icelandic purchasing power should have fallen. And yet, real purchasing power of Icelandic income earners held up better than that of Irish counterparts.

In projections through 2015, the IMF expect that per capita, PPP-adjusted GDP in Iceland will reach 10% above 2007 levels, while in Ireland it will reach 7.58% above 2007 level. This, once again, means that the IMF expect Icelandic income earners to fare better than their Irish counterparts.

The same is reflected in the gap between GDP per capita in Ireland and Iceland. This gap stood at 3,487.63 in favour of Ireland in 2007. By 2009 it fell to 832.61 and by 2010 rose to 2,135.11 still below 2007 levels. According to IMF projections, the gap is expected to be 2,788.53 by the end of 2015. Notice that the average gap between 2008 and 2015 will remain below its historical average levels for 2000-2007. This confirms that much of the underperformance in terms of absolute real GDP per capita discussed above is due to (1) historical trends and (2) price differentials between the two countries.

What about economic performance in the two countries relative to the global economy? Chart below shows the shares of each economy in total global GDP. In 2007, Iceland accounted for 0.019% of the world GDP, while Ireland accounted for 0.268%. By 2010 these shares were 0.016% and 0.237 respectively. The decline in Iceland was 15.79% and in Ireland 16.55%. So Iceland outperformed Ireland here.

By 2015 IMF expects Icelandic economy’s weight in the global economy to be 0.015% - a decline of 21.05% on 2007. For Ireland the same forecasts imply 0.215% weight in the global economy and a decline on 2007 of 24.30%. Again, Iceland is expected to outperform Ireland into 2015 in these relative (to global economy performance) terms.

Comparatives with Iceland aside, however, Irish economy is expected to reach, by 2015, virtually identical level of global economy share as it enjoyed between 1996 and 1997, in effect erasing the entire period of some 20 years worth of economic growth.As I mentioned before, Ireland clearly showing real deflation trend during the crisis, which is not the case for Iceland (in part, Icelandic inflation reflects devaluation of its currency).

It is worth noting that moderation in Icelandic economy inflation has been dramatic and highly orderly since 2008-2009 peak. This shows that the economy is expected to be adjusting through its post-default and post-devaluation period in an orderly fashion. In contrast, Irish deflation during the crisis has been pronounced and persistent.Now on to unemployment. It is clear that Irish unemployment is running at the rates more than 50% above those in Iceland. By the end of 2015, IMF forecasts Irish unemployment to be 9.5% and Icelandic unemployment to be 3.12% or more than 3 times lower than that in Ireland.

Again, note the dynamics of expected adjustments to peak unemployment in the two countries. IMF clearly forecasts unemployment to decline in Iceland at a much faster rate than in Ireland. Given that icelandic unemployment declines are more likely to arise from jobs creation, rather than emigration, while Irish unemployment declines are robustly influenced by rampant outward migration of displaced workers, these dynamics also reflect the deeply-troubled nature of the Irish economic crisis, when compared with that of Iceland.Which, in turn, shows that more likely than not, stronger Irish performance in GDP growth terms above is really driven by the MNCs and their transfer pricing, rather than real economic activity at the domestic economy. Lest I be accused of voicing anti-MNC sentiments - we do live in a society where saying factual things can get us labeled anything totally unrelated to the factual evidence presented - MNCs activities are great. All I am suggesting is that counting on them to carry us out of our real economy collapse (unemployment, shrinking employment, declining real disposable incomes etc) might be a bit naive.Although IMF provides no forecasts for employment numbers after 2011, we can use population statistics and employment numbers through 2011 to compare two countries in terms of employment rates as percent of total population. In 2007 51.76% of Icelanders were in employment – a percentage that declined to 45.20 in 2010 and is expected to fall to 45.09% in 2011. In Ireland, 2007 employment rate was 48.93%, and this has fallen to 41.18% in 2010 and is expected to be 41.33% in 2011. Again, in terms of employment rates Ireland is far behind Iceland – a sign that although out workers might be more productive (with a large share of this productivity accounted for by the transfer pricing by the MNCs), we tend to have smaller share of people working.

Do notice that the Icelandic economy performance in terms of employment takes place against the backdrop of having younger population than Iceland. Over the period of time covered, Iceland showed relatively stable rate of employment, while Ireland posted dramatic increases in employment rates during its growth period. This means that our current performance in terms of employment rates cuts against our demographic trends, while that of Iceland is in line with their demographic structures. In other words, one could have expected a decline in Icelandic employment rates even absent the crisis, while we should have expected continued increase in Irish employment rates absent the crisis.In terms of external trade, both countries have improved their chronic current account deficits throughout the crisis. However, the great exporting nation of Ireland have seen much more shallower improvements than those found in Iceland.

As I have argued in a different post (here), current account can be used as a metric of our ability to repay debt out of trade surpluses, once we account for transfers abroad to pay dividends and profits on earnings by the foreign investors into Ireland, including the MNCs, take in our own investors earnings from abroad etc Current account does not mask the extent of transfer pricing on our net exports Current account also links to Government debt costs and thus lends itself naturally to the second post to follow



Krugman makes exactly this point in his article (linked above), but he considers net exports instead of the current account. Chart above shows that between 2007 and 2010, Icelandic current account deficits fell from 16.29% of GDP to 0.91%. The Icelandic current account deficits are expected to continue declining through 2015, reaching forecast 0.38% of GDP by 2015. In Ireland, 2007-2010 decline was from 5.24% to 2.73%, while by 2015 the current account deficit is expected to fall to 1.24%.The reason I prefer using the current account is because of several reasons:As we show in the next post, much of the reason for better external economic balance performance of Iceland is due to lower transfers from Government to the foreign bondholders, s Icelandic debt is expected to perform much better through the entire crisis. This means Icelandic current account is going to be relatively stronger than Irish one, as Ireland is expected to lose increasingly larger share of its economy to payments to foreign debt holders in years to come.

8053,3275653,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/08/obamas-campaign-to-glorify-the-war-on-vietnam.html,"Wars exist because lies are told about past wars.

When President Obama escalated the war on Afghanistan, he revived virtually every known lie about the war on Iraq, from the initial WMD BS to the “surge.” While Americans remain unfathomably ignorant about the destruction of Iraq, a majority says the war shouldn’t have been fought. A majority says the same about the war on Afghanistan. This is, pretty wonderfully, impeding efforts toward a U.S. war on Syria or Iran.

The new wars were supposed to cure the Vietnam Syndrome — that public reluctance to support mass murder for no good reason. The Pentagon is now turning to the source of the disease. The war in most need of beautification for Americans, the military has decided, is the war the Vietnamese call the American War.

Most people in the United States have no idea that this was, like all other recent U.S. wars, a one-sided slaughter — in this case, of 3.8 million Vietnamese men, women, and children. But most Americans know the war was awful, even on the side of the aggressor. The Vietnam Syndrome (popular opposition to wars) still frightens war makers.

Obama is usually opposed to any “looking backwards,” as doing so might involve prosecuting criminals for their crimes. But, making a big exception, he is dumping 65 million of our dollars into prettying up the war on Vietnam.



Please read the following statement, put together by some U.S. veterans of that war, and sign onto it here.

An Open letter to the American People about a Project to Accurately Commemorate the American War in Viet Nam

We are coming up on the 50th anniversary of key moments in the American war in Viet Nam. As peace and justice activists, we believe it is crucial that the realities of the war be faced squarely. President Obama has announced his plan for a 13-year-long commemoration funded by Congress at $$65 million, featuring a full panoply of Orwellian forgetfulness and faux-patriotism. On May 25, 2012, President Obama proclaimed: “As we observe the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, we reflect with solemn reverence upon the valor of a generation that served with honor. We pay tribute to the more than 3 million servicemen and women who left their families to serve bravely, a world away from everything they knew and everyone they loved … fighting heroically to protect the ideals we hold dear as Americans. Through more than a decade of combat, over air, land, and sea, these proud Americans upheld the highest traditions of our Armed Forces.”. The purpose of the official proclamation — rather than honestly looking backward so as to glean and educate about important lessons — will be to promote an ex post facto justification of the war, lay lingering doubts to rest, and provide a stamp of approval without attending to or contending with the horrors of the war that many of us opposed.

The whole idea is a bit staggering, that this project was put into the hands of the Department of Defense (DoD) so that they can attempt – a half century later – to rewrite a tragic history which already has been distorted and manipulated by those in power in the US. The DoD is recruiting “partner” organizations from across the country to help them distort and silence much of the real history. Numerous events are scheduled over the next 12 years to “honor” our soldiers and extol the selfless sacrifices of Americans during an ugly period of our history. There will likely be little mention of the Vietnamese, and what the nation and the society of Viet Nam suffered as a result of U.S. intervention, nor of the resistance to the war by courageous and committed Americans. Almost certainly, the DoD project will not pay tribute to the voices and postwar reconciliation activities of many antiwar veterans.

Those years many of us remember, with painful acuity, as other than glorious. We feel compelled to make sure that the history of US involvement in Viet Nam is told truthfully.

Rather than let this Madison Avenue PR campaign just roll over us, we are viewing this as an opportunity to truly examine what happened during those tragic and tumultuous Viet Nam years, and use those lessons to turn American policy and shape a better future for ourselves and other nations. The US seems as committed as ever to military interventions heedless of the consequences for the invaded and occupied people or even for those called upon to invade and occupy.

We believe that an honest remembrance of what actually went on in Viet Nam is essential – to face the realities for the millions of Vietnamese civilians killed, maimed, poisoned, and traumatized; our soldiers propagandized, thrown into a ‘war of choice’; and subsequently largely abandoned to cope with postwar stress, our citizenry lied to and manipulated who came to recognize the war’s futility, if not its immorality.

It is incumbent on us not to cede the war’s memory to those who have little interest in an honest accounting and who want to justify further acts of military adventurism. The experience of the war ought to be cautionary against the fantasy of world dominance that besots many of our political and military leaders. What are the consequences of trying to control the fate of a people from afar with little understanding or interest — except for the purposes of counterinsurgency — in their history and culture, or their human desires? What are the consequences of dehumanized ideologies used to justify wars of aggression? To honor the Viet Nam generation and to inform current and future generations, we should make every effort to pass on a critical and honest history of the war.

As part of our counter-commemoration, we also will also pay tribute to the broad-based resistance to the war. Taking inspiration from the civil rights movement, an unprecedented opposition movement arose not just on campuses, but in the streets, in the military, and around family dinner tables. Millions of Americans resisted the war spontaneously, as well as in organizations ranging from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to the Chicano Moratorium, Women’s Strike for Peace, the War Resistors League, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, American Friend Service Committee, Students for a Democratic Society, Labor for Peace, Business Executives Move for Viet Nam Peace, and Vietnam Veterans Against the War, not to mention countless community groups. The movement made the morality of the war an issue for Americans, moving beyond the cost-benefit analysis favored by the punditocracy. The war was wrong, not just too costly; as Martin Luther King warned in his “Beyond Vietnam” speech: “the US was on the wrong side of the world revolution.”

In tandem with the civil rights, Black liberation, and women’s movements, the anti-war movement fostered a cultural and intellectual revolution which undermined Euro-centrism and traditional hierarchies while honoring the previously marginalized. Our grasp of history, culture, and human capacity was qualitatively expanded. We learned and demonstrated that history could be made by ordinary people; by people of color, by women, by the ignored and excluded.

The work around the quincentennial of Columbus’s voyages is a useful precedent. Originally designed as a celebration of Eurocentrism and empire, widespread grassroots action instead turned the quincentennial into a critique of the conquest and destruction of native peoples.

We therefore are inviting you to join us in developing a strategy for an antiwar commemoration with direct relevance for today. Here are some beginning, suggestive ideas to expose the truths of war and pose alternatives to its normalization by developing:

A central storehouse of information, a web site, and digitized archives; Curriculum for schools and colleges; A speaker’s bureau; A program on the model of the Viet Nam era’s teach-ins and Winter Soldier investigations; Our own commemorations of significant war and antiwar events.

Downgrading a state’s rating increases borrowing costs, and thus destabilizes the state’s economy. And, of course, many states may have more problems than just credit downgrades.

As I have long argued, if the feds are going to give bailouts to anyone, it should be individuals and the states – not the big financial giants – because preserving the states which make up the United States is a lot more important than maintaining the status quo financial system.

And unless the people have some relief, they will not be motivated to borrow from the banks, so all of the bank bailouts will be useless in restarting the economy.

The well integrity test is arguably failing, as the pressures are not

reaching the 8,000 psi minimum

target.

CBS News notes:

The

federal pointman for the BP oil spill says results are short of ideal

in the new cap but the oil will stay shut in for another 6 hours at

least. Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said on a Friday

afternoon conference that pressure readings from the cap have not

reached the level that would show there are no other leaks in the well. He

said the test will go ahead for another 6-hour period before being

reassessed to see if BP needs to reopen the cap and let oil spill out

again.

MSNBC writes:

Allen said two possible reasons were being debated by

scientists: The

reservoir that is the source of the oil could be running lower than

expected three months into the spill. Or there could be an undiscovered

leak somewhere down in the well.

The New York Times reports:

Thad W. Allen, the retired Coast Guard admiral who

is overseeing the response to the gulf oil spill, said that while there

were indications from the test that the well was in good shape, it was

not yet possible to rule out damage that could complicate efforts to

halt the leak permanently. “We want to be careful not to do

any harm or create a situation that could not be reversed,” he said in a

conference call with reporters Friday afternoon. *** Admiral Allen said the test would continue in six-hour increments and

that any new data would be reviewed by scientists and engineers from the

government, BP and other companies. He said there would be “enhanced

monitoring” of the seabed, including acoustic tests that could detect

tiny bubbles of methane gas coming from the bed, which would be evidence

of damage to the well. *** Admiral Allen said that such

a pressure buildup suggested that the well was not damaged. But he

said that the pressure level reached — about 6,700 pounds per square

inch, or more than 450 times atmospheric pressure — was below that

expected for an intact well. One explanation for the ambiguity,

he said, is that the reservoir of oil 13,000 feet below the seabed

could have been depleted by the well as it galloped out of control for

nearly three months. But another possibility is that the well is

breached, with oil and gas escaping into the rock or, worse, into the

gulf through the sea floor.

BP states

that the pressure in the well is only rising 2 pounds per square inch

each hour.

I will post a transcript of Allen's report when it becomes available (here is an unofficial, rough transcript). In the meantime, blogger Wang - who attended the press conference by

telephone - added

details from Allen's press conference (I simply edited for clarity of

reading; I will update with corrected and expanded transcript as I

receive it):

Uncertainty about the meaning of the pressure. Could

be lower because of well integrity, or the reservoir has become

somewhat depleted and so is lower in pressure than expected. The

initial curve of pressure build up was normal but stopped short of our

target which is the concern. Don't want to create harm or an

irreversible situation. Was the reservoir depleted or is there an

ongoing way for the oil to leave the well bore? We do not know the

condition of the well bore. There's a good chance it could be

depletion. Checking out the well bore. Checking for leaks. We have no

indication of a seafloor breach so it could be reservoir depletion.

Additional seismic surveys are required. This kind of formation

can maybe heal itself if we do damage it, the quickest way to reduce

pressure is opening the kill and choke line.If there is a problem we

will vent the oil. Reservoir depletion can be measured by

determining if there was an aquifer beneath the reservoir but there is

not one. If the seismic and acoustic show no sign of leakage we will

continue with the testing. NOAA boat looking for methane from the

sea floor with acoustic device. There is some concern about methane.

We want to make sure there is no methane. If we were to detect

methane we would lower the pressure by venting or ramp up Helix

Producer. We will reevaluate in 6 hours and have a series of

meetings (with the committee) everything moving forward is condition

based. We should have results in the next 6 hours. The 6 hour period

starts now.

There are actually at least four potential explanations for the low pressure

readings:

(1) There are substantial

leaks in the well; (2) There is leakage in the sands deep

under the seafloor. Oil industry professionals posting at the Oil Drum hypothesize:

What this could indicate is that there is a

possibility of crossflow at the bottom of the well. What this

means that the oil and gas that are flowing out of the reservoir into

the bottom of the well, are, under the pressure in the well, now flowing

into a higher reservoir of rock, now that they can't get out of the

well. Depending on where that re-injection flow is, this may, or may

not, suggest that the casing has lost integrity. This is a topic that

has been covered in the comments at The Oil Drum, where fdoleza -

""a petroleum engineering consultant retired from a major

multi-national oil company"" - has noted: ... I

believe the flow will be coming out of the bottom sand and going into

the upper sand. It would not be a leak, but it would tell them why

their pressure data ain't a classical surface buildup. And I sure hope

they're modeling temperatures and so on, because this is a very

interesting case. They don't have downhole gauges, so they'll have to

take the way the oil cools down as it sits to get a better idea of the

way things are moving down below. If there are

questions whether there is still flow in the formation or from the

original formation into surrounding rock, then it is possible that the

relief well (RW) is close enough to the original well (WW) that

putting a set of very sensitive microphones down the RW might allow

some triangulation to estimate where such a flow might be occurring.

It might make it easier that the well hasn’t been finally cased yet.

But the test has 2 days to run, and will be evaluated every 6 hours.

With time some of these questions may be answered as the test

continues. (If there is no flow anywhere, after a while all the

readings should become quite stable). (3) A

hypothesis proposed

by Roger N. Anderson - professor of marine geology and geophysics at

Columbia University - that the pressure could be rising slowly not

because of a leak, but because of some kind of blockage in the well:

""If it's rising slowly, that means the pipe's integrity's still there.

It's just getting around obstacles"" or (4) The reservoir

has been depleted more than engineers anticipated (although many experts

have said that the reservoir is much

bigger than BP has forecast; in any event, there are factors other

than size which determine pressure. For example, blowouts can reduce

pressure pretty quickly in some reservoirs)

While many oil industry experts are betting on damage to the well

bore or communication between layers of sand, Don Van Nieuwenhuise -

Director of the Professional Geoscience Programs at the University of

Houston - thinks

reservoir pressure has simply ""deflated"", and that 6,700 psi isn't

unexpected :

The

6,700 pound- per-square inch pressure reading logged inside the

blown-out Macondo well this morning may suggest that the well has lost

power over the almost three-month-long period it has flowed into the

Gulf of Mexico and not that the well is leaking somewhere beneath the

sea floor, a geologist who has been following the gusher said. The reservoir could have ""deflated"" since it began leaking April 20,

reducing the amount of pressure it is capable of producing, said [Van

Nieuwenhuise]. *** But Van Nieuwenhuise said this

morning's 6,700 pounds per square inch reading should not cause worry. ""I don't think it's a cause for immediate concern, because it could

reflect a natural loss of oil in the reservoir,"" Van Nieuwenhuise said.

""It's amazing that it has held its strength for as long as it has."" *** When they first said this, I said if they can get to 7,000 (pounds per

square inch) that would be good,"" Van Nieuwenhuise said. ""The 8,000 to

9,000 estimate reflects its initial pressure, but since it's been

bleeding so much, I'm not surprised it's at 7,000.""

Note 1:

Because pressures are still rising

(if only 2 lbs per hour), it probably means that the well

integrity test hasn't caused any new leaks so far.

industry expert Robert Cavner

The operator of the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant has been dumping something like a thousand tons per day of radioactive water into the Pacific ocean.

Remember, the reactors are “riddled with meltdown holes”, building 4 – with more radiation than all nuclear bombs ever dropped or tested – is missing entire walls, and building 3 is a pile of rubble.

The whole complex is leaking like a sieve, and the rivers of water pumped into the reactors every day are just pouring into the ocean (with only a slight delay).

Most people assume that the ocean will dilute the radiation from Fukushima enough that any radiation reaching the West Coast of the U.S. will be low.

For example, the Congressional Research Service wrote in April:

Scientists have stated that radiation in the ocean very quickly becomes diluted and would not be a problem beyond the coast of Japan. *** U.S. fisheries are unlikely to be affected because radioactive material that enters the marine environment would be greatly diluted before reaching U.S. fishing grounds.

And a Woods Hole oceanographer said:

“The Kuroshio current is considered like the Gulf Stream of the Pacific, a very large current that can rapidly carry the radioactivity into the interior” of the ocean, Buesseler said.

“But it also dilutes along the way, causing a lot of mixing and decreasing radioactivity as it moves offshore.”

But – just as we noted 2 days after the earthquake hit that the jet stream might carry radiation to the U.S. by wind – we are now warning that ocean currents might carry more radiation to the at least some portions of the West Coast of North America than is assumed.

Specifically, we noted more than a year ago:

The ocean currents head from Japan to the West Coast of the U.S. As AP notes: The floating debris will likely be carried by currents off of Japan toward Washington, Oregon and California before turning toward Hawaii and back again toward Asia, circulating in what is known as the North Pacific gyre, said Curt Ebbesmeyer, a Seattle oceanographer who has spent decades tracking flotsam. *** “All this debris will find a way to reach the West coast or stop in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” a swirling mass of concentrated marine litter in the Pacific Ocean, said Luca Centurioni, a researcher at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. Here is what the North Pacific Gyre looks like: NPR reports: CNN said that “the Hawaiian islands may get a new and unwelcome addition in coming months — a giant new island of debris floating in from Japan.” It relied in part on work done by the University of Hawaii’s International Pacific Research Center, which predicts that: “In three years, the [debris] plume will reach the U.S. West Coast, dumping debris on Californian beaches and the beaches of British Columbia, Alaska, and Baja California. The debris will then drift into the famous North Pacific Garbage Patch, where it will wander around and break into smaller and smaller pieces. In five years, Hawaii shores can expect to see another barrage of debris that is stronger and longer lastingthan the first one. Much of the debris leaving the North Pacific Garbage Patch ends up on Hawaii’s reefs and beaches.” Indeed, CNN notes: The debris mass, which appears as an island from the air, contains cars, trucks, tractors, boats and entire houses floating in the current heading toward the U.S. and Canada, according to ABC News. The bulk of the debris will likely not be radioactive, as it was presumably washed out to sea during the initial tsunami – before much radioactivity had leaked. But this shows the power of the currents from Japan to the West Coast.

An animated graphic from the University of Hawaii’s International Pacific Research Center shows the projected dispersion of debris from Japan:

Indeed, an island of Japanese debris the size of California is hitting the West Coast of North America … and some of it is radioactive.

In addition to radioactive debris, MIT says that seawater which is itself radioactive may begin hitting the West Coast within 5 years. Given that the debris is hitting faster than predicted, it is possible that the radioactive seawater will as well.

And the Congressional Research Service admitted:

However, there remains the slight potential for a relatively narrow corridor of highly contaminated water leading away from Japan … *** Transport by ocean currents is much slower, and additional radiation from this source might eventually also be detected in North Pacific waters under U.S. jurisdiction, even months after its release. Regardless of slow ocean transport, the long half-life of radioactive cesium isotopes means that radioactive contaminants could remain a valid concern for

ears.

Indeed, nuclear expert Robert Alvarez – senior policy adviser to the Energy Department’s secretary and deputy assistant secretary for national security and the environment from 1993 to 1999 – wrote yesterday:

According to a previously secret 1955 memo from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission regarding concerns of the British government over contaminated tuna, “dissipation of radioactive fall-out in ocean waters is not a gradual spreading out of the activity from the region with the highest concentration to uncontaminated regions, but that in all probability the process results in scattered pockets and streams of higher radioactive materials in the Pacific. We can speculate that tuna which now show radioactivity from ingested materials [this is in 1955, not today] have been living, in or have passed through, such pockets; or have been feeding on plant and animal life which has been exposed in those areas.”

Because of the huge amounts of radioactive water Tepco is dumping into the Pacific Ocean, and the fact that the current pushes water from Japan to the West Coast of North America, at least some of these radioactive “streams” or “hot spots” will likely end up impacting the West Coast.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Previously-Secret 1955 Government Report Concluded that Ocean May Not Adequately Dilute Radiation from Nuclear Accidents,"Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد, Units Please, Frank Energy",,[''],,,,

I am no psychiatrist, but the cheerful reports with today's news that Italian Government debt has declined month on month in February were met suggests to me a manifestation of the similar nature. Here are the facts. Italian public debt is down €6.8bn in February to €1,928 billion - a drop of 0.35% month-on-month. With a borrowing requirement down €1.4bn yoy in February, but flat at €12.7bn for two months January-February, compared to 12mos ago. It is the latter part - the static nature of Government borrowing requirements, not the former part - the reduction in debt, that matters most. The reason is simple - see charts below:You see, in January-February 2011, tax receipts were €56,370mln, against €53,940mln in Government expenditure, yielding 2mos cumulated balance surplus of €5,072mln. In 2012, same period tax receipts were €55,931mln or €439mln below 2011 figures, with Government spending at €54,290mln or €350mln ahead of same period last year. January-February 2012 Government balance was in surplus €5,302mln. So the debt 'repayments' are not a sign of any improvement in the fiscal dynamics.Now, there is a bit more to consider here, folks. The stated reduction in the Government debt is month-on-month and the statement above syas nothing about year-on-year comparison. Ok, so let's take Table 10 from April 16th Banca d'Italia data release. Column 1... errr... General Government Debt:February 2011 at €1,875,010 mln, against February 2012 at €1,928,211 mln.

This will push existent Italian bonds yields to 15% or 18% or more. We do not know, of course, exactly where the debt will be traded, but what we do know with almost certainty is that there is not a snowball's chance in hell Italy will be able to refinance maturing debt after 2013 on its own. So IMF lending Italy today commits IMF to lend to Italy in 2014 and on. €600 billion is unlikely to cover all Italian needs for 2012-2013, especially if Italian banks are to take a hit on other sovereign bonds. let me run through the EBA banks stress tests model under the following assumptions: Greece haircut 80%, Italy haircut 10%, Portugal haircut 25%, Spain haircut 10% (notice - all very benign) and CT1 ratio of 9%. Italian banks shortfall on capital is €34 billion. Now, recall that Italy also has insurance companies (e.g. A.Gen) and pensions funds - which will see some fall-outs from the haircuts as well. Say €10 billion. Italian bonds downgrade due to IMF lending (see item 1 above) is likely to cost banks and other financial sector companies another €11 billion and €4 billion. So we are into total bill of ca €60 billion right there. Italian deficits in 2012-2014 are expected to gross €76 billion per IMF latests forecasts. As shown in the chart above, debt maturity, plus new deficits financing will consume some €453.4 billion in 2012-2014 and €630.5 billion in 2012-2016.

There are some interesting reports in the media over the weekend, speculating that the IMF is preparing a super package for Italy, rumored to reach €600 billion. Here's a link from zerohedge that outlines the details of these rumors ( here ). There are several reasons to be skeptical as the feasibility of such a package and the potential effectiveness of it.Here are these reasons.Firstly, the IMF is a rules-based organization that normally can lend only 4-5 times (400-500%) of the country quota. Italy's country quota is SDR7.8823 billion or €10.7bn which can allow IMF to lend under normal arrangements up to €53.5 billion (at a severe stretch, I must add as the fund prefers not to lend to the full leverage of 500%).In addition, IMF has announced two new programmes last week (discussed here ). The Flexible Credit Line programme - whereby IMF does not specify lending leverage to be achieved, applies only to ""members with very strong track records... based on pre-set qualification criteria to deal with all types of balance of payments problems."" So IMF would have to qualify Italy as a country with ""strong track record"" and its solvency problems as ""balance of payments problem"". This, of couse, is possible, though not probable, as Italy's ""strong track record"" is hardly that ""strong"". In addition, the new lending will have to take place outside the normal arrangements mentioned above, as the deployment of such arrangements would not be consistent with ""strong track record"" even in theory. So to raise €600 billion, IMF will have to leverage Italy's SDR allocation 6,000%.Let's put this number into perspective. Lehman Bros TCE leverage ratio was 4,400% at the time of collapse and its average TCE leverage ratio prior to collapse was 3,100%.At any rate, IMF is most likely to assign Italy a precautionary borrower status under Precautionary Credit Line (see link above) which allows for 24 months leveraging up to 1,000%. This, of course means Italy will be able to raise just €107 billion through IMF loans or about 1/3rd of its roll-over requirements (not to mention new borrowings demand) through 2012.Secondly, suppose IMF does indeed lend Italy €600 billion - enough to barely cover the country refinancing needs for 2012-2013. Then, two things happen:So the total funding that Italy might require is in the neighborhood of €510-690 billion, depending on which period we assume the package will cover (2012 through either 2014 or 2016 respectively).And this assumes no deterioration in GDP growth (tax revenues) or deficit spending etc. It also assumes that market funding costs IMF built into its deficit forecasts (4% 10-year average pre-November 2010) remain under the IMF lending deal. In fact, of course, that is open to speculation if IMF can lend Italy €600 billion at anything below 5.3-5.8%.So overall, folks, I am skeptical as to the IMF's ability to conjure €600 billion for Italy. And furthermore, I am skeptical as to Italy's ability to manage cover for its deficits, banks and roll-over needs under such a package. This doesn't even begin to address my concerns as to Spain waiting in the shadows.Now, lastly, you might suggest that the IMF loans can come in conjunction with EFSF loans. Alas, the EFSF has some serious troubles itself - the following two posts from the zerohedge amply illustrate: here and here You see, Italytoo big to bail.

UK

The British government has finally admitted widespread contamination from the Sellafield plant.

The Guardian reports:

Radioactive pollution from the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria has led to children’s teeth across Britain being contaminated with plutonium. The Government has admitted for the first time that Sellafield ‘is a source of plutonium contamination’ across the country. Public Health Minister Melanie Johnson has revealed that a study funded by the Department of Health discovered that the closer a child lived to Sellafield, the higher the levels of plutonium found in their teeth. *** Johnson claimed the levels of plutonium are so minute that there is no health risk to the public. But this is disputed by scientists, MPs and environmental campaigners who have called for an immediate inquiry into how one of the world’s most dangerous materials has been allowed to continue to contaminate children’s teeth. There have long been claims of clusters of childhood leukaemia around Sellafield. *** Professor Eric Wright, of Dundee University Medical School, is one of the country’s leading experts on blood disorders and a member of the committee. He believes that the tiny specks of plutonium in children’s teeth caused by Sellafield radioactive pollution might lead to some people falling ill with cancer. He said: ‘There are genuine concerns that the risks from internal emitters of radiation are more hazardous [than previously thought]. The real question is by how much. Is it two or three times more risky… or more than a hundred?’

Japan

A Japanese nuclear power company was caught using employees to ask questions during televised hearing. The employees were told to impersonate private citizens who want nuclear reactors restarted.

Reuters reports on the political fallout of this and other shenanigans:

A Japanese nuclear power plant has come under fire for trying to sway the outcome of a public forum on atomic safety, dealing a fresh blow to the industry’s credibility four months after the world’s biggest nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. An employee with Kyushu Electric Power Co instructed workers at the utility and its affiliates to pose as ordinary citizens and send e-mails backing the restart of nuclear reactors in southern Japan to a televised public hearing. *** Analysts say the scandal reflects panic in Japan’s atomic power industry, long coddled by political, corporate and regulatory interests dubbed the “nuclear village” but now facing growing anti-nuclear sentiment as workers battle to end the Fukushima crisis. “There is growing suspicion that power companies are playing fast and loose with data to support their cause and will go so far as to orchestrate public support,” said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University’s Japan campus. “The more the media pulls back the veil, the angrier the public is getting.” The e-mail scandal has been daily fodder for mainstream media, often accused of being soft on the industry. Public trust in utilities and their regulators has already been dented by patchy and slow disclosure about the crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s Fukushima plant. “They (Tokyo Electric) have zero credibility,” Kingston said. Industry critics said the e-mail scandal was no surprise, but added it nonetheless deepened doubts about both safety and whether threatened power outages were a real risk. “The public reaction is leaning against nuclear power and I think the utilities feel a sense of crisis,” said Harumi Kondaiji, a local lawmaker in the western city of Tsuruga, host to three reactors. “At this point, we cannot believe them.” *** Even local authorities previously inclined to take the utilities at their word expressed anger. “We thought we had a relationship of trust, but now there are cracks,” Hideo Kishimoto, mayor of the southern town of Genkai which hosts the Kyushu Electric reactors in question, told a TV broadcaster.

Similarly, the Japan Times reports:

The Atomic Energy Society of Japan … issued a statement criticizing the government, Tokyo Electric Power Co. and other related institutions for delays and insufficiency in their disclosure of information concerning the accidents at Tepco’s Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant *** Since the Atomic Energy Society of Japan is regarded as close to Japan’s nuclear power establishment, the criticism bears importance all the more. *** The following point is especially important. The society notes that there is the possibility that the damage to people’s health from radiation exposure has increased because the government, Tepco and other related institutions did not properly disclose information on the status of the nuclear accidents and the environmental contamination by radioactive substances. *** The society notes that such vital information as the temperature of the lower section of the pressure vessels, the volume and temperature of the coolant water in the lower part of the pressure vessels, and the temperature of the molten nuclear fuel have yet to be released.

Tepco temporarily shut down the cooling system at the Fukushima Daini power complex, 7 miles from the leaking Fukushima Daiichi reactors. As Reuters notes:

The operator of Japan’s Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant, located near the tsunami-crippled Daiichi plant, on Thursday halted the cooling system at one of its reactors after electrical sparks were detected, Kyodo news agency reported.

While Tepco promised to restart the cooling system the same day (and presumably has or will soon re-start it), I have found no confirmation yet that this has occurred.

There was a fire at a third Japanese plant. As AGI reports:

[A] fire started in the nuclear waste disposal plant near reactor No. 2 in Tokai, in the East of Japan. Official sources reported that the blaze is now under control and that no radioactive material leak occurred.

The Japanese are “stress testing” other nuclear plants. For example, as NHK reports:



Nuke plant fails quake-resistance check … The Japanese government has found that electrical equipment at a nuclear power plant in eastern Japan does not meet earthquake-resistance standards. The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency inspected nuclear power plants nationwide after the March 11th earthquake damaged equipment at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant … The agency found that the level of quake-resistance of the electrical equipment at Tokai Daini nuclear power plant in Ibaraki Prefecture was below the standard set by power companies.

The one bright spot out of Japan was that the 3.3-ton device which had fallen into and crushed the Monju fast-breeder reactor was successfully removed, after a year of trying.

France

A transformer exploded and caught fire at the Tricastin, Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux (Drôme) nuclear power plant. Deutsche Presse Agentur noted on July 2nd:



In the southern French nuclear plant Tricastin it came to French media reports of an explosion. On the grounds of the southern French nuclear plant Tricastin, there have been media reports in France after a transformer explosion and fire. The fire department was able to bring the fire under control in the afternoon, it said on the website of the regional newspaper “Dauphine Libere” on Saturday. People were not injured. The management of the nuclear power plant north of Marseille on the incident itself did not immediately comment. The transformer was part of the reactor block 1, which is currently shut down, and was located outside the nuclear zone. Residents had reported thick black smoke. The nuclear power plant Tricastin with four pressurized water reactors of 915 megawatts each is in operation since 1981.

This wasn’t a huge accident, but it shows that the French are not immune from problems.

United States

There was a small leak in a nuclear reactor on a North Carolina college campus.

WRAL notes:

North Carolina State University officials said Thursday that there is a low-level water leak in the liner that surrounds the campus nuclear reactor, but that it poses no danger to the public. University spokesman Keith Nichols described the leak, discovered Saturday, as the size of a pinhead and that it was leaking about 10 gallons per hour from the 15,000-gallon tank. *** Nichols said it would be considered a public threat if the reactor were leaking at 350 gallons per hour. The university is in the process of repairing the leak

WTVD reports:

NC State said the leak was suspected on Friday and confirmed on Saturday. It said the public was not informed sooner because of the low level of danger. The amount of radioactivity was compared to what someone might receive getting an x-ray. The school says the leak is so small that special equipment is required to detect its location in the reactor’s lining. The company that can do that will not be in Raleigh until next week. In the meantime, the leak is being closely monitored. The reactor has been shut down since the leak was discovered.

(I’m not trying to blow this out of proportion; it was, indeed, a small leak.)

The Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant is still surrounded by floodwaters. Because there is so little information being released, it is difficult to assess the situation. As Xinuanet notes:

The Fort Calhoun plant north of Omaha in the US state of Nebraska has been surrounded by flood water from the Missouri River for over ten days. As worries mount, US authorities have reassured the public the plant is safe. Could this be another Fukushima? Operators of the Fort Calhoun plant say no. But pictures like this make it hard to believe the official statement that only part of the utilities are flooded. *** Plant operator, Omaha Public Power, says all key buildings in the plant are secure. No flooding, no meltdown, no radioactive leakage. They say the plant has nine power sources, and two backup generators, making a Fukushima scenario impossible. They’ve received some backing from the independent Union of Concerned Scientists. The group says despite some flooding inside, there are no severe safety problems.

Indeed, the plant’s operator is attempting to reinstall the AquaDam barrier tomorrow.

But nuclear expert Arnie Gundersen warns that the greatest danger would be if the intake structure – which is closest to the river – floods, as that is the structure which cools the reactor and spent fuel:

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ESVDI2OQZ4]

As the New York Times pointed out last month:

A year ago, those new defenses were not in place, and the plant’s hard barriers could have failed against a 1,010-foot flood, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission contends in a yearlong inspection and enforcement action against the plant’s operator, the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD). *** NRC inspectors concluded that at flooding levels above 1,008 feet, the plant “would experience a loss of offsite power and loss of intake structure” and water pumps providing essential cooling water to the plant.

Here’s a photo and drawing of the intake building:

My gut feeling is that Fort Calhoun will remain safe unless one of the upstream dams fails, or unless there is alot more rain than forecast.

A raging wildfire threatened to release plutonium and uranium from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. While the fire has burned areas polluted in the past with radioactive waste, firefighters have been heroically battling to keep the blaze away from the lab grounds itself. With help from rain, they appear to have largely succeeded (with the exception of some radiation released when radioactive vegetation was burned), although a new one-acre blaze broke out at a sensitive part of the lab. Officials blamed a squirrel.

People were told that the investment in their house was as solid as a rock:

Unfortunately, millions are now upside down, because the housing bubble – fed to a large extent by fraud – has burst:



And the people who supposedly verified the accuracy of mortgage documents never did so, and – in many cases – weren’t who they said there were:

The foreclosure scandal will likely depress the real estate market, as clear title for millions of homeowners comes into question.

This is obviously a huge problem.

But the largest problem for the economy could be – not from mortgages themselves – but from the securitizations of those mortgages:

Joshua Rosner – noted bond analyst, and Managing Director at independent research consultancy Graham Fisher & Co – told his clients Tuesday, that the impact from foreclosure gate on the securitized market could be huge.

As Shahien Nasiripour reports:

[Rosner] said he believes the paperwork problems regarding foreclosed properties will ultimately be resolved, he wrote that “We have a larger and more significant concern, which, if proved out, could call into question the validity of nearly all securitizations.” *** Rosner said, the current scandal “may give investors an opening to challenge the legality of deals, threatening to unnerve financial markets.” *** Those challenges, which would result from the revelations unearthed during the foreclosure process, could then be used to investigate the documentation practices that occurred when these mortgages were first given to borrowers. Inflated income levels, fake home appraisals and other lies inserted into mortgage documents — something Wall Street and Washington have long suspected, but never truly investigated — could then be used to force big banks to buy back the garbage they peddled in the first place to unwitting investors. Another possibility is that trustees, who oversee the flow of documents from the originator of the mortgage to the vehicle that holds those documents for investors, may not have properly performed their role, either. *** Just four firms dominate the trustee market for mortgage-backed securities in which the mortgages aren’t guaranteed by Uncle Sam: Deutsche Bank, U.S. Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon, and HSBC serve as trustees for 70.5 percent of all such issuance since 2005, according to Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter and data provider. An additional four firms — Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup — control 29.1 percent, Asset-Backed Alert data show. All told, these eight firms have served as trustees for 99.6 percent of all private-label mortgage-backed securities issued since 2005. Were the document errors now cropping up in a handful of cases “to be found to have resulted from [the] widespread failure of issuers and trusts” to properly handle and transfer documents, “there would … appear to be a strong legal basis for the calling into question [of] securitizations,” Rosner wrote.

Joshua Rosner On Foreclosure Fraud

As David Faber notes:



The worry centers on the mortgage loan pools created by many of the big banks as they fed the seemingly endless desire for mortgage-backed securities and CDO’s (collateralized debt obligations) made from them. It appears the mortgage content of many of those pools—created when the banks were dominating the mortgage securitization market in 2005, 2006 and 2007—may have been misrepresented. For example, an underwriter may have maintained that 80 percent of the mortgages in the pool were for primary residences when in fact far fewer were for that purpose. Or the underwriter stated that only 10 percent of the pool would be made of of “no-doc” loans—those that include less documentation about the borrower—when in fact the percentage was far higher. That could be fraud, and if so, the creator of the mortgage pool could be liable. Given that the market for private label RMBS (residential mortgage-backed securities) was $$1.5 trillion, the potential liability may be considerable. And while most of the originators of these mortgages are long gone, the securitizers are not.

(Because many there may be problems with many commercial mortgages as well, trillions more in commercial mortgage backed securities may also be at issue.)

Joshua Rosner agrees.

Rosner told Elliot Spitzer, the banks and rating agencies knew that 28% of the loans which the banks securitized and sold to pension funds and other investors didn’t meet underwriting standards. And yet they turned around and processed them into sausage (securitized them) and sold them to investors, representing that they did meet underwriting standards.

Rosner said that the rating agencies apparently intentionally avoided looking into this, since the more deals they approved, the more profits the rating agencies got. [For background on the financial incentive of rating agencies to give high ratings to literally anything, see this.]

And Rosner points out that – knowing about the high percentage mortgages which failed to meet underwriting standards – the big banks then bet against the housing market. Spitzer called that trading on inside information:

The potential securitization problem is why bank stocks are now in trouble. See this, this and this.

And as former Managing Director of Goldman Sachs Nomi Prins points out, the Bernanke and Geithner are terrified of a meltdown in the securitization market as well:

The free-market, let the banks do what they do mentality was what allowed them to create a $$14 trillion mountain of securities backed by precarious mortgages to begin with. *** But the real reason for Geithner’s reluctance about a foreclosure moratorium is that he’s scared stiff about those securities – because even if he won’t admit it, he knows that the bailout wasn’t just about TARP and Bernanke isn’t just an economic savior. *** If foreclosed homes couldn’t be sold because of fraudulent paperwork or had to wait for more detailed inspections, you can imagine how difficult selling assets stuffed with faulty loans might be. If it’s tough to find a title for a foreclosed home, think how tough it is to back the related loan out of a pyramid of securities sitting on top of it. See, the loan that might be analyzed in a foreclosure situation could be part of a chain connecting the underlying home to 20 or 50 different securitized assets, all depending on it for either the interest payments the loan was supposed to provide, or the value of the foreclosure property if those payments stopped (in Wall Street speak, the “recovery value”). If a foreclosed property isn’t selling, it’s not recovering any money back to any asset waiting for it. Think what that can do to the value of toxic assets living at the Fed and the Treasury Department. Kill it. The reason TARP and all the other subsidies happened was that Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, Tim Geithner (the pillage gang) and the most powerful Wall Street CEOs were scared. Banks had stopped trusting each other (no one cared about the person who couldn’t pay their mortgage, or had their home taken, whatever the reason). When there is no confidence in the market, there is no bid for securities, no matter what the reason. The banks couldn’t pay for all their leverage and they were facing bankruptcy if the system remained seized up. So the gang paid to keep the securitization market going, by finding a home or back-up home for the assets. They did not propose any remotely effective plan to help individuals at the loan level …. They merely enabled the worst practices and excesses to keep going in the name of saving the country from a greater depression, by shifting them to Washington and providing the illusion of demand for them. Foreclosure fraud is not new. Many sane people and organizations have been talking about fraud for years — you don’t manufacture $$14 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities and all their permutations and mega leverage out of $$1.4 trillion worth of subprime loans in five years without cutting a lot of corners. Banks knew that. But when the value of their assets plummeted, unlike individual borrowers, they got to dump them on the Fed and the Treasury department, while receiving cash injections and guarantees, and cheap money subsidies in return.

See this for more information on the government’s ill-conceived effort to prop up the prices of securitized assets.

As Congressman Brad Miller told Dylan Ratigan, failure to use subpoena power to audit the quality of the mortgages in the securitized pools held by Fannie and Freddie and to pursue all available legal rights to protect taxpayers from getting stuck with the bill for toxic securitized assets would constitute yet another stealth bailout of the big banks:

I am deeply concerned about the status of the United States healthcare system. Costs are escalating rapidly. At the same time, it's getting more and more difficult for patients like me to get an appointment with a doctor near home.

I support President Bush's approach to solving this problem--medical liability reform. The fact is, thousands of frivolous medical lawsuits are filed each year by individuals hoping to ""hit the lottery"" with a big court award. Even though fewer than 10% ever make trial, the costs of defending against these suits are high--and are ultimately passed down to patients. What's worse, when physicians can no longer afford the rising cost of liability insurance, they simply retire, leave the area, or limit the treatment they offer--leaving patients in many areas without adequate access to medical care.

The great thing about liability reform is that there are no losers--except the trial lawyers. Patients with legitimate suits will be able to recover unlimited economic damages to cover future medical expenses, lost wages, etc. Non-economic damages, like ""pain and suffering,"" would be capped at $$250,000.

This is a reasonable proposal that will have a positive impact on our healthcare system, and I encourage you, as my elected representative in Congress, to do everything in your power to get it passed. Thank you for your time.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Bush pop-up ads pushing Heathcare Plan!,"Backgroundurl Avatar_Large, Nickname, Joined, Created_At, Story Count, N_Stories, Comment Count, N_Comments, Popular Tags, Showtags Popular_Tags",,[''],,,,
8080,3275683,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,https://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/Net%20Government%20expenditure,"Having looked at the recession/expansion dynamics in Irish economy on foot of Q1 2013 figures ( here ), the dynamics in GDP and GNP in Ireland at the aggregate levels ( here ), and the mythology of the 'exports-led recovery' ( here ), let's round up the Q1 2013 QNA cover with a look at the expenditure-lined components of the GNP and GDP.Below we look at the Seasonally-adjusted Current Market Prices data.fell 2.21% in Q1 2013 q/q and was up 0.01% y/y. This compares against much more benign drop of -0.07% q/q in Q4 2012 and a 1.15% rise y/y. Since Q1 2011, when the Coalition came to power, Personal Expenditure is down 1.55%. In terms of q/q changes, Q1 2013 marked second consecutive quarter of declines.declined 0.1% q/q in Q1 2013 and was down 2.56% y/y. This marks moderation in declines recorded in Q4 2012 when q/q decline stood at -1.90% and y/y decline was running at -2.88%. Net Government Expenditure decline was the shallowest contributor to voerall economic contraction recorded in Q1 2013. Compared to Q1 2011, Net Government Expenditure on Current Goods & Services was down 3.98% in Q1 2013. In terms of q/q changes, Q1 2013 marked second consecutive quarter of declines.- the most devastated expenditure component of GNP to-date has fallen massive 7.32% in Q1 2013 in q/q terms and was down whooping 18.74% in y/y terms. This shows dramatic acceleration in decline from -2.16% drop in q/q terms in Q4 2012 and the reversal of the y/y rise of +4.31% recorded in Q4 2012. Relative to Q1 2011, Gross Fixed Capital Formation was down 14.25% in Q1 2013. In q/q terms, Q1 2013 marked second consecutive quarter of declines.shrunk 0.79% in Q4 2012 on q/q basis and there was 4.93% growth in y/y terms. This was then. In Q1 2013 exports of goods and services fell 4.59% q/q and were down 3.13% y/y. Relative to Q1 2011 exports of goods and services net of factor income payments were up 2.22% in Q1 2013, but we also marked two consecutive quarters of contraction here.were down 2.12% q/q in Q1 2013 and -3.13% y/y. This marks significant shift 'South' in the series compared to Q4 2012 when imports shrunk 1.05% q/q and were up 4.57% in y/y terms. Imports are running -0.05% down on Q1 2011 and Q1 2013 marks the second consecutive quarter of q/q declines.fell 0.6% q/q in Q4 2012 and there was annual growth of 0.38%. In Q1 2013, GDP fell 2.16% q/q and there was annual decline of 2.09%. This marks third consecutive quarter of decline in GDP and thus officially, return of the recession is dated to Q4 2012. The average rate of recessionary decline in GDP in the current episode is so far -1.06% per quarter. This is shallower than the previous recessionary episode (Q4 2008-Q4 2009) when GDP contractions averaged 2.76% per quarter. Compared to Q1 2011, Q1 2013 GDP at current market prices stood at -1.04%, or put differently, gross domestic product in Ireland in Q1 2013 stood below the levels attained in Q1 2011 when the current Government came to power.Net factor income from the rest of the world declined in both Q4 and Q1, with decline accelerating in Q1 2013 to 19.21% q/q from 2.92% in Q4 2012. As the result of this, GNP moved up, in the opposite direction of the GDP.grew 0.68% q/q in Q1 2013, down on 1.18% expansion recored in Q4 2012. On y/y basis, GNP grew 4.12% in Q4 2012 and by 4.26% in Q1 2013. Compared to Q1 2011, GNP is now up 2.46%.Bothandposted second consecutive quarter of q/q contraction in Q1 2013.To summarise,line of expenditure posted an increase in the Q1 2013 in terms of q/q changes once seasonal adjustments are taken into the account. In other words, the sole positive improvement in the numbers - relating to GNP - was drivenby reduced outflow of funds from MNCs.Worse, not a single line in the determination of the GDP in Ireland was up in q/q terms in any quarter since the end of Q3 2012. We had, put differently, 6 months of across the board contractions in the economy, when we consider expenditure-based definition of GDP.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Net Government expenditure, Irish recession, Irish GDP, Personal Consumption, QNA, Gross Fixed Capital Formation, Domestic demand, Irish growth crisis, Irish economic activity, Irish GNP",,

Kind of interesting, the same basic idea as the threads floated here in th runup to the first debate: What should Kerry ask, what zingers should he use, etc. The idea of the Freeper thread was that Bush could erase his embarrassing performance last Thursday if only he could dash off the perfect comeback line, to put Kerry in his place once and for all.

Free Republic Thread

The first thing I noticed in this thread is that we're MUCH funnier than they are. Maybe I just stumbled in on a bad day, but we're kicking their ass in the humor wars.

But here is a bit of unintentional humor I found:

Bush speaks best when speaking from the heart, not when answering unexpected debate-style questions. He should stick to his brief simple messages that he knows so well, and that can be more effectively sound-bitten.

He should stick to his brief simple messages? If I'm not mistaken he tried that already last Thursday. Didn't turn out too well, did it?

Amidst the recent firming up in global conditions, it is important to remember that per capita GDP (in US Dollar terms) in both the euro area and the UK remains below the pre-crisis peaks. In absolute terms, euro area cumulated 2008-2013 losses in GDP per capita range from EUR 1,311 for Malta to EUR 56,496 for Ireland, with the euro area average losses of EUR 20,318. No advanced economy within the EU27 has managed to recover cumulative losses in GDP per capita to-date. On average, euro area GDP per capita in 2013 is forecast to be 9.7% lower than pre-crisis. Across other advanced economies, the GDP per capita is expected to be 8.4% higher in 2013. While this makes the euro area a strong candidate for growth in 2014-2015, absent apparent catalysts for longer term gains in value added, and TFP and labour productivity expansion, a European recovery can be a short-lived bounce-back, rather than a dawn of a New Age.

My reading of the play, however, indicates that in the context in which this statement was made, Shakespeare was actually praising lawyers and especially their protection of the individual’s property and personal liberty.

Shakespeare’s play describes the conflict between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, which is known in history as the “Wars of the Roses.”

Because the House of York believed that it had a better claim to the crown, York decides to stir up a rebellion and in Act III Scene I, he admits that he has “seduced a headstrong Kentishman, John Cade of Ashford to make a commotion, as full well he can.” The purpose is to start a rebellion and therefore start a war in which York can assert his claim.

In Act IV Scene II, Cade is discussing how they will start the war and begin oppression of the people by taking away their property and individual liberty but his collaborator, by the name of Dick, states that “The first thing we do, lets kill all the lawyers.” The context in which this is stated is that if you are going to oppress the people you need to kill the lawyers first.

We’ve extensively documented that institutional corruption in the United States has led to a collapse in trust … which is hurting the economy.

And that the same thing is happening worldwide:

And that corruption has skyrocketed recently.

CBS News reports today:

According to a survey released Tuesday [by the international anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International], a majority of people across the globe feel that corruption has worsened in their countries, and that their governments are ineffective in combating it. According to the survey, more than one in four people reported paying a bribe in the past year.

*** The survey asked respondents to rate the corruption level of their countries’ institutions on a one-to-five scale, in which five meant “extremely corrupt.” Political parties were considered to be the most corrupt globally, with an average score of 3.8 out of 5. “As political parties require money in order to run their campaigns, one of the big corruption risks for political parties is how they are funded,” Transparency International wrote in its report. “The interests of the people and organizations that fund political parties can have a large influence on the actions of those parties.”

Transparency International’s “Global Corruption Barometer” asked respondents to rate institutions on a corruption scale./ Transparency International

Political parties fared worse in the United States, where the 1,000 respondents surveyed gave them a corruption score of 4.1. Globally, police came in a close second, with a corruption score of 3.7. Nearly a third of respondents who came into contact with police reported having paid a bribe. *** And while 53 percent of respondents felt corruption had increased in the last two years, a majority also believed that their governments couldn’t fix the problem. According to the report, 54 percent of respondents view government as ineffective in combating corruption, up from the 47 percent recorded in Transparency International’s 2010-2011 survey. “When there is widespread belief that corruption prevails and that the powerful in particular are able to get away with it, people lose faith in those entrusted with power,” Transparency International said. In the survey, 54 percent of respondents felt that governments largely run for the benefit of self-interested groups. In the U.S., 64 percent said the government is run by a few big interests, compared with 5 percent who felt the same in Norway, and 83 percent in Greece.

8096,3275701,trueeconomics.blogspot.com,unknown,http://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/search/label/EU%20Sanctions,"Cutting Russian bank's access to SWIFT system (spearheaded in EU by the UK and Poland back in August 2014 and backed by the EU Parliament resolution from September 2014);

Widening sanctions against imports of Russian goods and services across broader categories and applying more pressure on the emerging markets (traditionally more important to Russian exporters of industrial machinery and capital goods) to abstain from dealing with Russian suppliers (though it is hard to see what can be added to the current list); and

Expanding the lists of Russians banned from travel to the U.S. and Europe (which would be a weak form of response, unless it starts explicitly impacting travel for ordinary Russians - a suggestion that was floated in late 2014 by a number of former U.S. high ranking officials and analysts, with some going as far as suggesting the U.S. should ban all travel for Russian citizens, regardless of circumstances or their residency). In addition, expanding the list of sanctioned individuals to cover members of their families (to allow arrests of their property abroad, especially in those cases where such property ownership is de facto linked to the originally sanctioned officials and business leaders).

Big change in EU official language marks a major departure from the past diplomatic practice: https://euobserver.com/foreign/127667 . Let's see if this continues, but at the very least, it lays foundations for renewed pressure on Moscow in relation to Ukrainian conflict.Both the U.S. (see https://euobserver.com/foreign/127754 ) and the EU (see here: https://euobserver.com/foreign/127703 ) have stepped up pressure for new sanctions.Here is my take on the prospect of the latter.Rumours of the U.S. (and by proxy EU) sanctions extension include, once again:All of these proposals, at their extreme, will be firstly painful, but secondly non-reversible in the short- and medium- run.The latter would signify that any restoration of normal relations between the U.S. (and Europe) and Russia will no longer be feasible even in the medium term and will demonstrably fail President Obama's own test of sanctions as being a tool for influencing short term policies' outcomes without directly adversely impacting ordinary Russians or sacrificing the objective of long-term normalisation.In financial terms, cutting Russian banks off SWIFT will compound the already significant pressures on Russian corporates and banks, leading to retaliatory measures that will likely see Russian banks and companies suspending repayment and servicing of forex loans to non-affiliated entities based in the U.S. and the EU. This, financially-speaking 'nuclear' retaliation, is feasible given the downgrades of the Russian sovereign debt by Moody's and S&P: the lower the ratings go, the lower is the cost of counter-measures.In return for this, Western lenders are likely to ask for (and easily receive) court orders to cease Russian assets abroad.In effect, the worst case scenario here will be an all-out unwinding of Russian economic integration into the Western European and U.S. economies - a process that will make all sanctions irreversible in the medium term. The tail end of this risk is that a more isolated Moscow will face even lower future costs from taking a more aggressive stance in Ukraine or elsewhere. Economic escalation, at this stage, will most likely result in a political escalation along the lines of 'cornering Russia' into retaliation.But beyond the Russian-U.S./EU theatre of confrontation, there looms another shadow.In explicitly deploying economic agents and institutions in a geopolitical conflict against a significant global economic player, the U.S. is risking undermining the very foundation of its own economic power and with it, the power of the West. A long-term economic conflict with Russia is putting all emerging markets and non-Western economies on notice: the U.S. markets and institutions can be a high risk counter-parties, controlled and driven by the political considerations. Until now, targeted nature of sanctions has avoided this risk. And until now, SWIFT and its backers in Europe have made a cogent argument that excluding Russia from the system of banks payments clearance risks undermining the system itself. If Russia, in partnership with China, were forced to develop own system of parallel clearance to rival SWIFT, the West will lose control over the financial transactions pipeline that can be monitored and used to combat illicit trade, financing of terrorism and tax evasion. With time, we will also risk losing major transactions flows between other emerging markets and the West, with resultant de-internationalisation of the global financial flows and a reduction in the West's ability to tap emerging markets surplus savings and liquidity to underwrite long-term Western pensions and investment needs.Similarly, tax evasion has been put on the declining trend by enhanced international cooperation - a process that is now driving the likes of the OECD reforms efforts in corporate taxation. This too will become more difficult to deliver if the global economic systems, largely based on Western institutions, revert toward regionalisation.As I said, these are tail risks, but they are risks nonetheless.Furthermore, broadening of sanctions to target explicitly Russian entities and citizens regardless of their affiliation or position vis-a-vis Moscow political regime will have another hefty long-term risk premium. The West is hoping for the sanctions to drive significant economic decline across Russia to effect a regime change, if not in terms of the physical head of Russian state, then in terms of his core policies. However, broadly anti-Russian (as opposed to counter-Kremlin) sanctions are likely to trigger more nationalist revival in Russia and any regime change in such circumstances is likely to lead to an even more bellicose stance from Moscow. Current political opposition within Russia, even theoretically capable of asserting control over power systems in the political and executive systems, is simply much more nationalistic and anti-Western than we, in Europe and the U.S., would like to believe.None of this should override the consideration of the urgent need to restore peace in and territorial integrity of Ukraine, first and foremost. And, as I said on numerous occasions before, the onus is on Russia to act decisively to make this possible: by forcing the Eastern Ukrainian separatists to implement Minsk accord pro-actively, ahead of the Ukrainian counterparts and with fully verifiable results.But, in the game of sanctions escalation, longer term losses for both, Russia and the West, will be significant.It is worth noting that even Mikhail Khodorkovsky - hardly a supporter of the current regime in Moscow - has repeatedly warned against sanctions being deployed as a tool against the ordinary Russians and the Russian economy at large. See here: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27513321 and here: http://www.enpi-info.eu/eastportal/news/latest/39323/EU-needs-to-differentiate-sanctions-against-Russia,-Mikhail-Khodorkovsky-tells-MEPs Another prominent - and actually more important in terms of his popularity and position in Russia - opponent of the current Government, Alexey Navalny also called for strongly targeted sanctions that avoid damaging the economy and, thus, increasing nationalist axis power within the country: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/opinion/how-to-punish-putin.html although Navalny did contradict himself in some later statements (see for example a report here: http://joinfo.com/world/1001120_Alexei-Navalny-if-not-for-sanctions-Putins-army.html ).Beyond that, there has been significant enough analysts' coverage of the sanctions trap risks - the adverse impact of sanctions on the West's own objectives: the more effective the sanctions are in destabilising Russia, the more they reduce Western capacity to effect change in Russia in the longer run (see here: http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR117_TheNewEuropeanDisorder_ESSAY.pdf ).",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,True Economics,"Constantin Gurdgiev, View My Complete Profile",,[''],"Economics, Europe, Financial Markets, Investment, Economics, Financial Crisis, Banks, Finance, Euro, Russia, Ireland, Fiscal, Risk, Hedge, Gold","Russia-Ireland trade, US sanctions, Hungary, Ukraine, Russia, EU Sanctions, EUObserver, Russian Budget, Ukraine conflict, US banks, EU-Russia trade, Russia sanctions, nuclear power, Russian economy, Russian sanctions, US policy, EU banks, Russian banks, Russian bonds, Sanctions",,

Union Leader Staff

BOSTON - Elaine and Edward Brown, the Plainfield convicted tax evaders who holed up in their fortress-like home for nine months in a stand-off with federal marshals, will remain in prison after their appeals were rejected by the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals.The Browns were convicted in January 2007 but, instead of appearing in U.S. District Court in Concord for sentencing, they retreated to their 100-acre property stockpiled with weapons.The court, in its 48-page ruling issued Thursday, summarized what happened leading up to the Browns' arrests. The U.S. Marshals conducted surveillance of the property and decided to try to arrest Mr. Brown during his daily all-terrain trip to the mailbox. The federal agents hid in the woods on June 7, 2007 waiting for him but were outed by the couple's dog while being walked by Daniel Riley, a friend of the Browns. The federal agents fired non-lethal ammunition at Daniel Riley as he fled, but missed. He was eventually taken into custody after being zapped with a stun gun.Mr. Brown heard the commotion and appeared at the tower on top of his house with a .50-caliber rifle but he did not fire.By that time, the Browns had gained national notoriety and supporters were flocking to their home where they hosted festival-type gatherings publicizing their resistance. The Marshals decided to take advantage of that notoriety by posing undercover as supporters.In October 2007, the Marshals learned the Browns wanted some property from the office of Mrs. Brown, who was a dentist. The undercover officers picked up the items and brought them to the Browns' home. They unloaded the property as Mr. Brown watched, an assault rifle leveled at them and expressing his reticence to trust people he didn't know.According to the court ruling, Mr. Brown eventually warmed up to the undercover officers, and put down the rifle replacing it with a handgun in his waistband. Then he joined the federal agents in some beers and pizza. The group hung out on the Browns' front porch and, after Elaine joined them, an undercover officer signaled other Marshals who moved in to make the arrests.Later, agents found ""a vast supply of explosives, firearms, and ammunition, including rifles, armor piercing bullets, pipe bombs, and bombs nailed to trees,"" on the property, according to the court.At trial, the couple was found guilty of numerous charges including plotting to kill federal agents during the 2007 standoff; conspiring to prevent federal officers from performing their duties; conspiring to assault, resist or impede federal officers; using or carrying a firearm or destructive device during a violent crime; possessing a firearm or destructive device, being a felon in possession of a firearm; obstruction of justice; failing to appear at sentencing. Mr. Brown was also charged with failing to appear at trial.Edward Brown was sentence to 37 years, and Elaine Brown, 35 years.On appeal, the Browns raised numerous challenges. He argued the federal judge should have held a hearing to determine his competency but the appellate court rejected that, saying though his behavior was often bizarre, it was not evidence of confusion but reflected ""firmly held, idiosyncratic political beliefs punctuated with a suspicion of the judiciary."" The court pointed out that his attorney never raised the issue of his competency.Mr. Brown also argued he lacked the intent needed to commit the conspiracy counts to thwart the marshals from performing their duties because ""he did not believe they were engaged in 'official duties' since he considers tax laws unconstitutional and therefore his tax trial convictions illegitimate."" The justices rejected the argument outright, saying, ""This circuitous logic is faulty.""The court also ruled statements by then U.S. Marshal Stephen Monier and another federal agent concerning threats the Browns made were not hearsay because they were admitted at trial not for their truth but to show why the marshals had come up with an elaborate plan to arrest the Browns. And, they said, testimony Monier gave as an ""overview witness"" of the case, was not improper.Elaine Brown, the court also ruled, opened the door to those statements being admitted when during opening statements she said she had to protect herself against unlawful government force - force her counsel referred to as ""the same sort of lethal government force as the civilian victims in the 1992 shooting of Randy Weaver's wife and son at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and of the 1993 government assault at the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, Texas.""She also challenged the admission of several books recovered from her home including ""The Anarchist Handbook"" ""Guerrilla Warfare and Special Forces Operations,"" ""Unconventional Warfare Devices and Techniques,"" ""Booby Traps,"" and ""Modern Chemical Magic."" She maintained admitting them was inflammatory and violated her rights to a fair trial.The court again disagreed saying, at a minimum, the books and titles were relevant to show Mrs. Brown had knowledge of ""how to conduct armed resistance against the government and the factual implementation of such resistance against the government.

8108,3275713,washingtonsblog.com,bias,http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/07/matthew-simmons-lightning-rod-for-gulf-oil-controversy.html,"Matthew Simmons has made a lot of big claims about the oil spill (see videos below).

Because of his background, Simmons has been interviewed repeatedly in television, newspaper and radio media. Simmons was an energy adviser to President George W. Bush, is an adviser to the Oil Depletion Analysis Centre, and is a member of the National Petroleum Council and the Council on Foreign Relations, and is former chairman and CEO of Simmons & Company International, an investment bank catering to oil companies.

People have become polarized around Simmons as a lightning rod. For example, people who believe all of Simmons’ claims believe that anyone who questions any of Simmons’s claims is working for BP. On the other extreme, people who think Simmons has gone senile or is simply talking his book (he’s short BP) tar and feather anyone who questions BP’s version of the Gulf narrative as being a crazy Simmons follower.

So let’s assess Simmons’ claims one-by-one. And – more importantly – let’s refocus the discussion away from one person and towards the Gulf itself (Simmons himself will either be vindicated, proven off-base, or something in between. But that is his personal concern, not ours).

BP’s stock Will Go to Zero

Simmons predicts that BP’s stock will go to zero. he might be right. Fines under the Clean Water Act are $$4,300 per barrel of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. And civil and criminal damages could be substantial.

But BP has been doing everything in its power to lowball the amount of oil spilled into the Gulf (and see this), even though it easily could have easily quantified how much oil is spilling. If the government allows BP to get away with lowballing the spill number, the fines won’t bankrupt BP.

Similarly, if the government let’s BP maintain its $$75 million liability cap on economic damages, let’s BP hide the extent of the damage to the Gulf (see this and this), to perform only a superficial clean up of the Gulf and fails to press criminal charges (or let’s BP off with a slap on the wrist), then BP might survive by selling assets.

And remember, BP is still one of the largest suppliers of oil to the U.S. military. See this and this.

In addition, Gordon T. Long argues that the failure of BP would have a greater affect on the U.S. economy than the failure of Lehman.

So some say that – even if it’s wrong – BP will be considered “too big to fail” and will be bailed out.

There is a “Lake of Oil” in the Gulf

Simmons claims there is a “lake of oil” in the Gulf, 30 feet thick and miles long.

I don’t know about this claim, but scientists have found giant underwater plumes, and NOAA has just announced traces of oil 30 meters thick stretching for quite a ways. See this, this, this and this. Specifically, because millions of gallons of Corexit have been applied, many solid plumes have been broken up into giant bodies of solution … mixtures of water, oil, methane and dispersant.

But these solutions can contain levels of oil and other chemicals which are at or near the levels which are toxic to marine life (see below).

BP Has Killed the Gulf

Simmons told Bloomberg that BP has “killed the Gulf”.

Obviously, the effect on the Gulf will be severe – at least in the short run – especially because BP has used millions of gallons of Corexit dispersant, which is highly toxic to animals.

An independent scientist from the University of Georgia – Dr. Joye – says that government scientists are underestimating the amount of oxygen depletion in the Gulf waters. Dr. Joye says that it’s not a conspiracy. Rather, government scientists have only been studying oxygen levels close to the blown out well. However, oxygen levels are much lower 3-15 kilometers from the leaking wellhead (the water right near the wellhead has been recently exposed to oil, and so the oil and methane-eating bacteria haven’t had a chance to start breaking it down yet. Further away from the spill site, the bacteria breaks down the oil and methane more, depleting oxygen in the process.) See this Wall Street Journal article.

Indeed, as Dr. Joye notes, scientists have no idea how the large quanties of dispersant will effect the Gulf’s microbial communities (for more information, watch part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4 and part 5 of Dr. Joye’s July 13th press conference).

The bottom line is that the use of so much Corexit in combination with such huge amounts of oil is a science experiment, and no one knows the outcome. This might kill the Gulf. Or the Gulf might bounce back surprisingly fast.

Rob Kendall, director of Texas Tech’s Insitute of Environmental & Human Health, says:

This is a catastrophe of enormous proportions. To me, this is the biggest environmental toxicology experiment we’ve ever conducted.

And Kim Withers, a coastal ecologist at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi notes:

It’s like the biggest science experiment ever. Unfortunately, it’s a completely uncontrolled experiment.

We Should Evacuate the Gulf

On one extreme, Simmons says that the health effects from the huge quantities of oil and methane released from the oil gusher, plus the huge quantities of Corexit used by BP, have created a toxic brew which could kill 20 million Gulf coast residents. He therefore says we should evacuate the Gulf coast.

On the other extreme, the EPA, NOAA and other government agencies have tried to downplay all potential health effects, according to a senior EPA analyst and many others. Indeed, the head of the EPA said:

I am walking a fine line between truth and hysteria. We don’t want to create a panic.

Hurricanes could – under the right conditions – spread oil and toxic chemicals inland. See this and this.

Marine toxicologist Dr. Ricki Ott and senior EPA analyst Hugh Kaufman both say that Gulf coastal communities should be evacuated.

And University of California Santa Barbara scientist and marine geochemistry expert Dr. David Valentine says that – at least when BP is burning oil or gas – the area around the spill site “had a cloud of smoke hanging over it at all times”, composed of surface burn smoke and the methane flair-up. He said the burns form “one thick mass of clouds, and when it rains, a lot of junk comes down from the particulate“.

I simply don’t know enough about how Corexit, oil and methane combine to know how toxic a brew it could really become, so I don’t know whether evacuations should be implemented.

We Should Nuke the Well

Simmons says that the only thing which will stop the oil spill is a small nuclear bomb inserted deep into the well.

I have researched this issue, and believe that the use of a nuke has more risk than benefit.

However, conventional explosives – in the hands of top underwater demolition experts working closely with top Gulf geologists – might be helpful if the relief wells fail.

There is a Second, Bigger Leak Miles from the Leak We’ve Seen on the Videos

Perhaps Simmons’ best-known claim is that there is a second, bigger leak miles away from the leak we’ve seen on the videos. Simmons claims that what we’ve watched on the underwater videos is a smaller leak at the riser, and that the main well is miles away and gushing 130,000 barrels a day. He claims that there is a conspiracy by BP to cover this up.

The claim that BP has hid the real well from the American people seems contradicted by the evidence we have at this point. And while I can’t say for sure that the claim of a second, bigger leak somewhere else is false, I have seen nothing to confirm this to date.

However, given that BP has not provided even basic information to the Congressional Committee chairman who demanded it in writing, that BP has done everything it could to cover up the severity of the problems in the Gulf (see this, this and this), and that we only see what BP chooses to aim its cameras at, we need to discover some basic facts about the situation before we can even discuss this intelligently.

Moreover, because NOAA has discovered other nearby leaks or seeps and because Admiral Thad Allen says that the seep 3 kilometers away from the blown out well is from the Rigel gas field, it is vital to find out what’s really going on. See this, this and this.

And a whistleblower previously told 60 Minutes, there was an accident at the rig a month or more before the April 20th explosion:



[Mike Williams, the chief electronics technician on the Deepwater Horizon, and one of the last workers to leave the doomed rig] … says going faster caused the bottom of the well to split open, swallowing tools and that drilling fluid called “mud.” “We actually got stuck. And we got stuck so bad we had to send tools down into the drill pipe and sever the pipe,” Williams explained. That well was abandoned and Deepwater Horizon had to drill a new route to the oil. It cost BP more than two weeks and millions of dollars.

Where did this incident occur? Was there any leak of oil, or only a loss of equipment into the drilling mud? Have the underwater cameras, seismic and sonar equipment taken a look at this location to make sure everything is stable and is not leaking?

Similarly, as Bloomberg reports, problems at the well actually started in February:

BP Plc was struggling to seal cracks in its Macondo well as far back as February, more than two months before an explosion killed 11 and spewed oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It took 10 days to plug the first cracks, according to reports BP filed with the Minerals Management Service that were later delivered to congressional investigators. Cracks in the surrounding rock continued to complicate the drilling operation during the ensuing weeks. Left unsealed, they can allow explosive natural gas to rush up the shaft. “Once they realized they had oil down there, all the decisions they made were designed to get that oil at the lowest cost,” said Peter Galvin of the Center for Biological Diversity, which has been working with congressional investigators probing the disaster. “It’s been a doomed voyage from the beginning.” *** On Feb. 13, BP told the minerals service it was trying to seal cracks in the well about 40 miles (64 kilometers) off the Louisiana coast, drilling documents obtained by Bloomberg show. Investigators are still trying to determine whether the fissures played a role in the disaster.

Why do investigators think fissures back then might have played a part in the April 20 explosion and blowout?

The answers to the above questions must be disclosed so that we can assess what’s really going on in the Gulf of Mexico.

This is an unedited version of myarticle from April 20, 2014.Nothing sums up frustrations of the policymakers and general public with economics as well as the famous quote from the US President, Harry S. Truman: “Give me a one-handed economist, all my economists say is ‘on the one hand …and on the other hand…”Quips aside, human choices and activities - the fundamental forces driving all economics - are unpredictable and painfully complex to model and measure. But beyond behavioural intricacies, complex nature of modern economic systems implies that data we use in analysis is often rendered non-representative of the realities on the ground.Take for example the concept of the national income. Economists define this as a sum of personal expenditure on consumer goods and services, net expenditure by Government on current goods and services, domestic fixed capital formation, changes in stocks and net exports of goods and services. Combined these form Gross Domestic Product or GDP. Adding Net Factor Income from the Rest of the World (profits and dividends flowing from foreign destinations into Ireland, less payments of similar outflows from Ireland) gives us Gross National Product or GNP.All of this seems rather straightforward when it comes to an average country analysis. By and large the overall changes GDP and GNP are closely linked to other economic performance indicators, such as inflation, investment, employment and household incomes.Alas, this is not the case for a tiny number of small open economies with significant share of international activities in their total output, such as Ireland. In such economies, both GDP and GNP can be severely skewed by tax optimisation and global rent-seeking strategies of multinational enterprises. Faced with large share of domestic accounts distorted by tax arbitrage, economists are left to deal with high degrees of uncertainty when forecasting national output and employment. Even past data becomes hard to interpret.In recent months, various analysts published a wide range of forecasts and predictions for Irish economy for 2014-2015. Consider just three sources of such forecasts: Department of Finance, the ESRI and the IMF.Budget 2014 projections, forming the basis of our fiscal policy predicted average annual real GDP growth of 2.15 percent, with underlying real GNP growth of 1.7 percent. These projections were based on the assumed annual growth of 1.5 percent in personal consumption, and 6.35 percent growth in investment. These projections were also in-line with IMF forecasts.Around the same time, ESRI was forecasting GDP growth of 2.6 percent for 2014 and GNP growth of 2.7 percent, well ahead of the Department of Finance outlook. ESRI forecasts were much more skewed in favour of domestic investment and personal consumption.Fast-forward six months to today. In its latest analysis, IMF lowered its forecast for our GDP growth to 1.7 percent for 2014, leaving unchanged their outlook for 2015. The Fund forecast for GNP growth remained unchanged for 2014 and was raised for 2015.ESRI has shifted decidedly into even more optimistic territory. The Institute's latest predictions are for GDP expansion of 3.05 percent on average in 2014-2015. GNP growth forecast is now at 3.6 percent. ESRI's rosy projections are based on expectations of a massive 10 percent growth in investment, with private consumption expectations also ahead of previous projections.Finally, this week, Department of Finance upgraded its own forecasts, lifting expected 2014-2015 growth to 2.4 percent for GDP and 2.5 percent for GNP. Domestic demand growth is now expected to average 2.4 percent through 2015, and investment growth is expected to run at a head-spinning rate of 13.9 percent.Everyone, save the IMF, is getting increasingly bullish on Irish domestic economy, which, in return, spells good news for employment and household finances.The problem is that all of these forecasts give little comfort to anyone seriously concerned with the impact of economic growth on the ground, in the real economy.Even the ESRI now admits that we cannot forecast this economy with any degree of precision. More significantly, the Institute recognises that our GDP figures are no longer meaningful when it comes to measuring actual economic performance. Instead, the ESRI claims that GNP is a better gauge of the real state of the Irish economy.In truth, the proverbial rabbit hole does not end there: Irish GNP itself is still heavily skewed by the very same distortions that render our GDP nearly useless.The ongoing changes in our exports and imports composition are throwing thick fog of obscurity over our net exports, which account for 22.6 percent of our GDP and 26.7 percent of our GNP – not a small share.Since 2012, expiration of international patents in the pharmaceutical sector, triggered billions in lost exports revenues and shrinking trade surplus. In colloquial terms, Irish economy is now running weak on expired Viagra.Just how much the patent cliff depresses our GDP and GNP is a mater of dispute, but we do know that pharma accounts for about one quarter of our total exports and one eighth of the gross value added in economy despite employing very few workers here. The patent cliff was responsible for a massive 1.25 percent drop in our labour productivity across the entire economy last year. But, as ESRI analysis previously shown, the overall effect of patents expirations on our GDP (and by corollary on GNP) is extremely sensitive to the assumptions relating to where pharma companies book their final profits. Profits booked in Ireland yield significant adverse impact. Profits channeled through Ireland to offshore destinations have negligible impact.Which brings us to the second force contributing to rendering both GDP and GNP growth largely irrelevant as measures of our economic wellbeing.Based on data through Q4 2013, since the bottom of the Great Recession in 2010, our net exports of goods and services rose EUR10.6 billion, driven by EUR14.4 billion in new exports of services offset by the decline of EUR3.05 billion in exports of goods. Ireland’s exports-led recovery was associated with a massive shift toward ICT exports.Much of this trade was associated with little real activity on the ground.Consider for example tax revenues. In 2010-2013, for each euro in added net exports, the Exchequer revenues increased by less than 3.3 cents. Back in 2000-2002 period the same relationship was more than six times higher. Of course back then both the MNCs and domestic companies were in rude health or on steroids of cheap credit and patents protection, depending on how a two-handed economist might look at the numbers. Still, the core composition of our exports was more directly connected to real production and value creation taking place in this country.This can be directly witnessed by looking at other metrics of current activity, such as Purchasing Manager Indices published by Markit and Investec Ireland. Since Q1 2010, both Services and Manufacturing PMIs have been consistently signaling a booming economy. Meanwhile, GDP posted an average annual rate of growth of just 0.22 percent. Employment in industry ex-construction is down 21 percent on pre-crisis peak, employment in professional, scientific and technical activities is down 4.3 percent and employment in information and communication sector is down 1.1 percent.The new crop of multinational corporations driving growth of GDP and GNP in Ireland is much more aggressive at tax optimisation than their predecessors. Which means that they also tend to use fewer domestic resources to deliver real value added on the ground.All of which suggests that gauging true extent of economic growth in Ireland is no longer a simple matter of looking at either GDP or GNP figures. Instead, we are left with other aggregate measures of the real economy, such as: non-agricultural employment and the final domestic demand – a sum of private and public consumption and gross fixed capital formation.By the latter metric, this economy has managed to deliver 6 consecutive years of uninterrupted annual declines in activity. In 2013, inflation-adjusted domestic demand fell by some EUR366 million on previous year. Cumulated losses since 2008 now stand at EUR32 billion or almost 20 percent of our GDP. Good news is that the rate of declines has been de-accelerating every year since 2009. And in H2 2013 demand rose 1.75 percent year on year. Bad news is that in real terms, our final domestic demand is currently running at the levels just above those recorded in 2003. In other words, we are now into the eleventh year of the ‘lost decade’. At H2 2013 rate of growth, it will take Ireland until 2026-2027 to regain pre-crisis levels of domestic economic activity.Meanwhile, employment figures are painting a slightly more optimistic picture, albeit these figures too are not free of methodological problems. In Q4 2013, non-agricultural employment in Ireland stood at 1,793,000, with H2 figures on average up 1.91 percent or 33,550 on the same period of 2012. To-date, non-agricultural employment numbers are down 13 percent or 266,550 on pre-crisis levels. However, when one considers total population changes in Ireland since the onset of the crisis, the ratio of non-agricultural employment to total population is currently at 39 percent, which is the level below those recorded in Q4 2000.To the chagrin of the Irish policymakers and general public, our economy is, like an average economist, two-handed.

Harry Truman really had it easy compared to Enda Kenny.The latest data from the Central Bank covering retail interest rates confirms two key trends previously highlighted in this column.The first one is the rising cost of borrowing compared to the underlying European Central Bank policy rate. In January-February 2014, average retail rates on new loans for house purchases were priced 3.32 percent higher than the ECB rate. A year ago the same margin was 2.89 percent. For non-financial corporations, average margin rose from 4.58 percent to 5.03 percent for loans under EUR1 million, and from 2.42 percent to 3.1 percent for new loans over EUR1 million. Lending margins over the ECB rate in January-February 2014, averaged two to three times the margins charged in the same period of 2007 at the peak of credit bubble.The second trend relates to the spread between rates paid by the banks on deposits and interest charged on loans. Since October 2011, Irish households consistently faced deposit rates that are by some 2 percentage points lower than the average annual cost of new loans for house purchases. In January-February 2014 this gap widened by some 0.27 percent compared to the same period of 2013. The spread is now running at double the rate recorded at the peak of the pre-crisis credit boom. The same holds for interest rates differential between loans and deposits for non-financial corporations which is now at the second largest levels since January 2003 when the data reporting started.In short, credit today is historically more expensive, while deposits are cheaper.

This is an unedited version of myarticle from April 20, 2014.Nothing sums up frustrations of the policymakers and general public with economics as well as the famous quote from the US President, Harry S. Truman: “Give me a one-handed economist, all my economists say is ‘on the one hand …and on the other hand…”Quips aside, human choices and activities - the fundamental forces driving all economics - are unpredictable and painfully complex to model and measure. But beyond behavioural intricacies, complex nature of modern economic systems implies that data we use in analysis is often rendered non-representative of the realities on the ground.Take for example the concept of the national income. Economists define this as a sum of personal expenditure on consumer goods and services, net expenditure by Government on current goods and services, domestic fixed capital formation, changes in stocks and net exports of goods and services. Combined these form Gross Domestic Product or GDP. Adding Net Factor Income from the Rest of the World (profits and dividends flowing from foreign destinations into Ireland, less payments of similar outflows from Ireland) gives us Gross National Product or GNP.All of this seems rather straightforward when it comes to an average country analysis. By and large the overall changes GDP and GNP are closely linked to other economic performance indicators, such as inflation, investment, employment and household incomes.Alas, this is not the case for a tiny number of small open economies with significant share of international activities in their total output, such as Ireland. In such economies, both GDP and GNP can be severely skewed by tax optimisation and global rent-seeking strategies of multinational enterprises. Faced with large share of domestic accounts distorted by tax arbitrage, economists are left to deal with high degrees of uncertainty when forecasting national output and employment. Even past data becomes hard to interpret.In recent months, various analysts published a wide range of forecasts and predictions for Irish economy for 2014-2015. Consider just three sources of such forecasts: Department of Finance, the ESRI and the IMF.Budget 2014 projections, forming the basis of our fiscal policy predicted average annual real GDP growth of 2.15 percent, with underlying real GNP growth of 1.7 percent. These projections were based on the assumed annual growth of 1.5 percent in personal consumption, and 6.35 percent growth in investment. These projections were also in-line with IMF forecasts.Around the same time, ESRI was forecasting GDP growth of 2.6 percent for 2014 and GNP growth of 2.7 percent, well ahead of the Department of Finance outlook. ESRI forecasts were much more skewed in favour of domestic investment and personal consumption.Fast-forward six months to today. In its latest analysis, IMF lowered its forecast for our GDP growth to 1.7 percent for 2014, leaving unchanged their outlook for 2015. The Fund forecast for GNP growth remained unchanged for 2014 and was raised for 2015.ESRI has shifted decidedly into even more optimistic territory. The Institute's latest predictions are for GDP expansion of 3.05 percent on average in 2014-2015. GNP growth forecast is now at 3.6 percent. ESRI's rosy projections are based on expectations of a massive 10 percent growth in investment, with private consumption expectations also ahead of previous projections.Finally, this week, Department of Finance upgraded its own forecasts, lifting expected 2014-2015 growth to 2.4 percent for GDP and 2.5 percent for GNP. Domestic demand growth is now expected to average 2.4 percent through 2015, and investment growth is expected to run at a head-spinning rate of 13.9 percent.Everyone, save the IMF, is getting increasingly bullish on Irish domestic economy, which, in return, spells good news for employment and household finances.The problem is that all of these forecasts give little comfort to anyone seriously concerned with the impact of economic growth on the ground, in the real economy.Even the ESRI now admits that we cannot forecast this economy with any degree of precision. More significantly, the Institute recognises that our GDP figures are no longer meaningful when it comes to measuring actual economic performance. Instead, the ESRI claims that GNP is a better gauge of the real state of the Irish economy.In truth, the proverbial rabbit hole does not end there: Irish GNP itself is still heavily skewed by the very same distortions that render our GDP nearly useless.The ongoing changes in our exports and imports composition are throwing thick fog of obscurity over our net exports, which account for 22.6 percent of our GDP and 26.7 percent of our GNP – not a small share.Since 2012, expiration of international patents in the pharmaceutical sector, triggered billions in lost exports revenues and shrinking trade surplus. In colloquial terms, Irish economy is now running weak on expired Viagra.Just how much the patent cliff depresses our GDP and GNP is a mater of dispute, but we do know that pharma accounts for about one quarter of our total exports and one eighth of the gross value added in economy despite employing very few workers here. The patent cliff was responsible for a massive 1.25 percent drop in our labour productivity across the entire economy last year. But, as ESRI analysis previously shown, the overall effect of patents expirations on our GDP (and by corollary on GNP) is extremely sensitive to the assumptions relating to where pharma companies book their final profits. Profits booked in Ireland yield significant adverse impact. Profits channeled through Ireland to offshore destinations have negligible impact.Which brings us to the second force contributing to rendering both GDP and GNP growth largely irrelevant as measures of our economic wellbeing.Based on data through Q4 2013, since the bottom of the Great Recession in 2010, our net exports of goods and services rose EUR10.6 billion, driven by EUR14.4 billion in new exports of services offset by the decline of EUR3.05 billion in exports of goods. Ireland’s exports-led recovery was associated with a massive shift toward ICT exports.Much of this trade was associated with little real activity on the ground.Consider for example tax revenues. In 2010-2013, for each euro in added net exports, the Exchequer revenues increased by less than 3.3 cents. Back in 2000-2002 period the same relationship was more than six times higher. Of course back then both the MNCs and domestic companies were in rude health or on steroids of cheap credit and patents protection, depending on how a two-handed economist might look at the numbers. Still, the core composition of our exports was more directly connected to real production and value creation taking place in this country.This can be directly witnessed by looking at other metrics of current activity, such as Purchasing Manager Indices published by Markit and Investec Ireland. Since Q1 2010, both Services and Manufacturing PMIs have been consistently signaling a booming economy. Meanwhile, GDP posted an average annual rate of growth of just 0.22 percent. Employment in industry ex-construction is down 21 percent on pre-crisis peak, employment in professional, scientific and technical activities is down 4.3 percent and employment in information and communication sector is down 1.1 percent.The new crop of multinational corporations driving growth of GDP and GNP in Ireland is much more aggressive at tax optimisation than their predecessors. Which means that they also tend to use fewer domestic resources to deliver real value added on the ground.All of which suggests that gauging true extent of economic growth in Ireland is no longer a simple matter of looking at either GDP or GNP figures. Instead, we are left with other aggregate measures of the real economy, such as: non-agricultural employment and the final domestic demand – a sum of private and public consumption and gross fixed capital formation.By the latter metric, this economy has managed to deliver 6 consecutive years of uninterrupted annual declines in activity. In 2013, inflation-adjusted domestic demand fell by some EUR366 million on previous year. Cumulated losses since 2008 now stand at EUR32 billion or almost 20 percent of our GDP. Good news is that the rate of declines has been de-accelerating every year since 2009. And in H2 2013 demand rose 1.75 percent year on year. Bad news is that in real terms, our final domestic demand is currently running at the levels just above those recorded in 2003. In other words, we are now into the eleventh year of the ‘lost decade’. At H2 2013 rate of growth, it will take Ireland until 2026-2027 to regain pre-crisis levels of domestic economic activity.Meanwhile, employment figures are painting a slightly more optimistic picture, albeit these figures too are not free of methodological problems. In Q4 2013, non-agricultural employment in Ireland stood at 1,793,000, with H2 figures on average up 1.91 percent or 33,550 on the same period of 2012. To-date, non-agricultural employment numbers are down 13 percent or 266,550 on pre-crisis levels. However, when one considers total population changes in Ireland since the onset of the crisis, the ratio of non-agricultural employment to total population is currently at 39 percent, which is the level below those recorded in Q4 2000.To the chagrin of the Irish policymakers and general public, our economy is, like an average economist, two-handed. On the one hand, our employment and total demand figures show an economy anemically bouncing close to the bottom. On the other hand, a handful of MNCs are pushing our GDP and GNP stats up with profits from their operations in far flung places retired here.

For example, the Houston Chronicle noted on June 21st:

A report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Monday noted research vessels found natural gas seeping from the sea floor several miles away from the well.

While many might be quick to take this as confirmation of Matt Simmons’ claims that there is another leak directly caused by the sinking of the drilling rig, the Chronicle goes on to explain:

Those appear to be pre-existing seeps that occur naturally, a NOAA spokeswoman said, and unrelated to the spill.

But the Washington Post made a very important point yesterday:

Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University, said additional leaks are a possible source of deep-sea plumes of oil detected by research vessels. But this part of the gulf is pocked with natural seeps, he noted. Conceivably the drilling of the well, and/or the subsequent blowout, could have affected the seeps, he said. “Once you started disturbing the underground geology, you may have made one of those seeps even worse,” he said.

Remember that geologists have said that if the well casing is substantially breached, the oil and methane gas will find a way through fractures in the surrounding geology and make it into the ocean. For example, the Houston Chronicle notes:



If the well casing burst it could send oil and gas streaming through the strata to appear elsewhere on the sea floor ….

Obviously, if there are natural oil or gas seeps nearby, there are already pre-existing channels up to the seafloor … so that may very well be the path of least resistance for the subterranean oil to flow up to the seafloor.

Therefore, if there were a substantial breach in the well bore, nearby natural oil and gas seeps could very well increase in volume.

Because BP would like to minimize leak estimates to minimize the damages it has to pay under the Clean Water Act, BP would undoubtedly try to pretend that the nearby natural seeps always had the same volume. In other words, the owner of the oil drilling prospect where the spill is occuring – BP – may be the only party to have mapped out the nearby seeps (Anadarko and Mitsui were partners with BP in the oil prospect; but – as passive partners – they probably didn’t take a hands-on approach to such details).

So don’t be surprised if – when formerly tiny seeps become gushers – BP tries to pretend that they were always that large.

Indeed – given BP’s track record of prevarication – don’t be shocked if BP pretends that brand new gushers are ancient, natural seeps.",2017-11-18T20:01:27.400599,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852671,2018-02-07 23:39:33.852696,Oil Spill Might Be Making Natural Seeps Larger,"Posted On, Black Swan, حاتم حماد",,[''],,,,

Since the entire economy depends on consumption for its “growth,” and discretionary consumption is financed with either cash or debt, that leads to two questions: 1) who has cash to spend on non-essentials and 2) who is credit-worthy enough to borrow money for non-essentials?

What makes a household credit-worthy? A) disposable income, i.e. cash left over after servicing debt and paying for essentials, and B) assets that can act as collateral for loans.

Since the top 10% take home 50% of all household income, it follows that this top slice has most of the discretionary cash:

The top 10% is also the only slice whose income has exceeded inflation over the past four decades:

In terms of assets that can serve as collateral, the top 5% own most of the nation’s household wealth. So not only do the top 10% earn most of the income, they also own most of the assets that can serve as collateral for loans:

Much has been written recently about the extreme concentration of wealth in the top .1%. The point here is that the top 9.9% may be doing OK, but much of the wealth owned by the top 10% is concentrated in the top .1%.



Since real income for all wage earners has declined since 2007 when adjusted for inflation, we have to ask just how well the top 9.9% is doing in terms of purchasing power.

Can the top .1% prop up the economy with their spending? Yes, they can prop up Maserati sales and buy $$10 million vacation condos, but there simply aren’t enough super-wealthy to do the job. As for the top 1%, they can prop up the local Porsche dealership and pay dock fees at the yacht club, but there aren’t enough of them, either: around 1.5 million qualify as top 1%.

The top 5% households number around 6 million out of 121 million households, but that’s not a big enough number to fill every high-end bistro and private school in the nation. So that leaves the top 10%, the 12 million households with half the income and roughly 80% of the assets, with the task of spending enough free cash or credit-money to prop up an economy that depends on serial asset bubbles for massive injections of unearned income.

Is the top 10% up to the task of borrowing and blowing enough money to prop up a debt and bubble-dependent economy? Right now, we’re one stock-market-and-housing bubble pop away from finding out if the top 10% will be able and willing to spend, spend, spend once their bubblicious assets are evaporating like mist in Death Valley.

Instead, we are left with other aggregate measures of the real economy, such as: non-agricultural employment and the final domestic demand – a sum of private and public consumption and gross fixed capital formation.By the latter metric, this economy has managed to deliver 6 consecutive years of uninterrupted annual declines in activity. In 2013, inflation-adjusted domestic demand fell by some EUR366 million on previous year. Cumulated losses since 2008 now stand at EUR32 billion or almost 20 percent of our GDP. Good news is that the rate of declines has been de-accelerating every year since 2009. And in H2 2013 demand rose 1.75 percent year on year. Bad news is that in real terms, our final domestic demand is currently running at the levels just above those recorded in 2003. In other words, we are now into the eleventh year of the ‘lost decade’. At H2 2013 rate of growth, it will take Ireland until 2026-2027 to regain pre-crisis levels of domestic economic activity.Meanwhile, employment figures are painting a slightly more optimistic picture, albeit these figures too are not free of methodological problems. In Q4 2013, non-agricultural employment in Ireland stood at 1,793,000, with H2 figures on average up 1.91 percent or 33,550 on the same period of 2012. To-date, non-agricultural employment numbers are down 13 percent or 266,550 on pre-crisis levels. However, when one considers total population changes in Ireland since the onset of the crisis, the ratio of non-agricultural employment to total population is currently at 39 percent, which is the level below those recorded in Q4 2000.To the chagrin of the Irish policymakers and general public, our economy is, like an average economist, two-handed. On the one hand, our employment and total demand figures show an economy anemically bouncing close to the bottom. On the other hand, a handful of MNCs are pushing our GDP and GNP stats up with profits from their operations in far flung places retired here. Harry Truman really had it easy compared to Enda Kenny.The latest data from the Central Bank covering retail interest rates confirms two key trends previously highlighted in this column.The first one is the rising cost of borrowing compared to the underlying European Central Bank policy rate. In January-February 2014, average retail rates on new loans for house purchases were priced 3.32 percent higher than the ECB rate. A year ago the same margin was 2.89 percent. For non-financial corporations, average margin rose from 4.58 percent to 5.03 percent for loans under EUR1 million, and from 2.42 percent to 3.1 percent for new loans over EUR1 million. Lending margins over the ECB rate in January-February 2014, averaged two to three times the margins charged in the same period of 2007 at the peak of credit bubble.The second trend relates to the spread between rates paid by the banks on deposits and interest charged on loans. Since October 2011, Irish households consistently faced deposit rates that are by some 2 percentage points lower than the average annual cost of new loans for house purchases. In January-February 2014 this gap widened by some 0.27 percent compared to the same period of 2013. The spread is now running at double the rate recorded at the peak of the pre-crisis credit boom. The same holds for interest rates differential between loans and deposits for non-financial corporations which is now at the second largest levels since January 2003 when the data reporting started.In short, credit today is historically more expensive, while deposits are cheaper.

This is an unedited version of myarticle from April 20, 2014.Nothing sums up frustrations of the policymakers and general public with economics as well as the famous quote from the US President, Harry S. Truman: “Give me a one-handed economist, all my economists say is ‘on the one hand …and on the other hand…”Quips aside, human choices and activities - the fundamental forces driving all economics - are unpredictable and painfully complex to model and measure. But beyond behavioural intricacies, complex nature of modern economic systems implies that data we use in analysis is often rendered non-representative of the realities on the ground.Take for example the concept of the national income. Economists define this as a sum of personal expenditure on consumer goods and services, net expenditure by Government on current goods and services, domestic fixed capital formation, changes in stocks and net exports of goods and services. Combined these form Gross Domestic Product or GDP. Adding Net Factor Income from the Rest of the World (profits and dividends flowing from foreign destinations into Ireland, less payments of similar outflows from Ireland) gives us Gross National Product or GNP.All of this seems rather straightforward when it comes to an average country analysis. By and large the overall changes GDP and GNP are closely linked to other economic performance indicators, such as inflation, investment, employment and household incomes.Alas, this is not the case for a tiny number of small open economies with significant share of international activities in their total output, such as Ireland. In such economies, both GDP and GNP can be severely skewed by tax optimisation and global rent-seeking strategies of multinational enterprises. Faced with large share of domestic accounts distorted by tax arbitrage, economists are left to deal with high degrees of uncertainty when forecasting national output and employment. Even past data becomes hard to interpret.In recent months, various analysts published a wide range of forecasts and predictions for Irish economy for 2014-2015. Consider just three sources of such forecasts: Department of Finance, the ESRI and the IMF.Budget 2014 projections, forming the basis of our fiscal policy predicted average annual real GDP growth of 2.15 percent, with underlying real GNP growth of 1.7 percent. These projections were based on the assumed annual growth of 1.5 percent in personal consumption, and 6.35 percent growth in investment. These projections were also in-line with IMF forecasts.Around the same time, ESRI was forecasting GDP growth of 2.6 percent for 2014 and GNP growth of 2.7 percent, well ahead of the Department of Finance outlook. ESRI forecasts were much more skewed in favour of domestic investment and personal consumption.Fast-forward six months to today. In its latest analysis, IMF lowered its forecast for our GDP growth to 1.7 percent for 2014, leaving unchanged their outlook for 2015. The Fund forecast for GNP growth remained unchanged for 2014 and was raised for 2015.ESRI has shifted decidedly into even more optimistic territory. The Institute's latest predictions are for GDP expansion of 3.05 percent on average in 2014-2015. GNP growth forecast is now at 3.6 percent. ESRI's rosy projections are based on expectations of a massive 10 percent growth in investment, with private consumption expectations also ahead of previous projections.Finally, this week, Department of Finance upgraded its own forecasts, lifting expected 2014-2015 growth to 2.4 percent for GDP and 2.5 percent for GNP. Domestic demand growth is now expected to average 2.4 percent through 2015, and investment growth is expected to run at a head-spinning rate of 13.9 percent.Everyone, save the IMF, is getting increasingly bullish on Irish domestic economy, which, in return, spells good news for employment and household finances.The problem is that all of these forecasts give little comfort to anyone seriously concerned with the impact of economic growth on the ground, in the real economy.Even the ESRI now admits that we cannot forecast this economy with any degree of precision. More significantly, the Institute recognises that our GDP figures are no longer meaningful when it comes to measuring actual economic performance. Instead, the ESRI claims that GNP is a better gauge of the real state of the Irish economy.In truth, the proverbial rabbit hole does not end there: Irish GNP itself is still heavily skewed by the very same distortions that render our GDP nearly useless.The ongoing changes in our exports and imports composition are throwing thick fog of obscurity over our net exports, which account for 22.6 percent of our GDP and 26.7 percent of our GNP – not a small share.Since 2012, expiration of international patents in the pharmaceutical sector, triggered billions in lost exports revenues and shrinking trade surplus. In colloquial terms, Irish economy is now running weak on expired Viagra.Just how much the patent cliff depresses our GDP and GNP is a mater of dispute, but we do know that pharma accounts for about one quarter of our total exports and one eighth of the gross value added in economy despite employing very few workers here. The patent cliff was responsible for a massive 1.25 percent drop in our labour productivity across the entire economy last year. But, as ESRI analysis previously shown, the overall effect of patents expirations on our GDP (and by corollary on GNP) is extremely sensitive to the assumptions relating to where pharma companies book their final profits. Profits booked in Ireland yield significant adverse impact. Profits channeled through Ireland to offshore destinations have negligible impact.Which brings us to the second force contributing to rendering both GDP and GNP growth largely irrelevant as measures of our economic wellbeing.Based on data through Q4 2013, since the bottom of the Great Recession in 2010, our net exports of goods and services rose EUR10.6 billion, driven by EUR14.4 billion in new exports of services offset by the decline of EUR3.05 billion in exports of goods. Ireland’s exports-led recovery was associated with a massive shift toward ICT exports.Much of this trade was associated with little real activity on the ground.Consider for example tax revenues. In 2010-2013, for each euro in added net exports, the Exchequer revenues increased by less than 3.3 cents. Back in 2000-2002 period the same relationship was more than six times higher. Of course back then both the MNCs and domestic companies were in rude health or on steroids of cheap credit and patents protection, depending on how a two-handed economist might look at the numbers. Still, the core composition of our exports was more directly connected to real production and value creation taking place in this country.This can be directly witnessed by looking at other metrics of current activity, such as Purchasing Manager Indices published by Markit and Investec Ireland. Since Q1 2010, both Services and Manufacturing PMIs have been consistently signaling a booming economy. Meanwhile, GDP posted an average annual rate of growth of just 0.22 percent. Employment in industry ex-construction is down 21 percent on pre-crisis peak, employment in professional, scientific and technical activities is down 4.3 percent and employment in information and communication sector is down 1.1 percent.The new crop of multinational corporations driving growth of GDP and GNP in Ireland is much more aggressive at tax optimisation than their predecessors.
